        'u'Compares values numerically.

        If the signs of the operands differ, a value representing each operand
        ('-1' if the operand is less than zero, '0' if the operand is zero or
        negative zero, or '1' if the operand is greater than zero) is used in
        place of that operand for the comparison instead of the actual
        operand.

        The comparison is then effected by subtracting the second operand from
        the first and then returning a value according to the result of the
        subtraction: '-1' if the result is less than zero, '0' if the result is
        zero or negative zero, or '1' if the result is greater than zero.

        'b'Plus corresponds to unary prefix plus in Python.

        The operation is evaluated using the same rules as add; the
        operation plus(a) is calculated as add('0', a) where the '0'
        has the same exponent as the operand.

        'b'Raises a to the power of b, to modulo if given.

        With two arguments, compute a**b.  If a is negative then b
        must be integral.  The result will be inexact unless b is
        integral and the result is finite and can be expressed exactly
        in 'precision' digits.

        With three arguments, compute (a**b) % modulo.  For the
        three argument form, the following restrictions on the
        arguments hold:

         - all three arguments must be integral
         - b must be nonnegative
         - at least one of a or b must be nonzero
         - modulo must be nonzero and have at most 'precision' digits

        The result of pow(a, b, modulo) is identical to the result
        that would be obtained by computing (a**b) % modulo with
        unbounded precision, but is computed more efficiently.  It is
        always exact.

        'b'Returns a value equal to 'a' (rounded), having the exponent of 'b'.

        The coefficient of the result is derived from that of the left-hand
        operand.  It may be rounded using the current rounding setting (if the
        exponent is being increased), multiplied by a positive power of ten (if
        the exponent is being decreased), or is unchanged (if the exponent is
        already equal to that of the right-hand operand).

        Unlike other operations, if the length of the coefficient after the
        quantize operation would be greater than precision then an Invalid
        operation condition is raised.  This guarantees that, unless there is
        an error condition, the exponent of the result of a quantize is always
        equal to that of the right-hand operand.

        Also unlike other operations, quantize will never raise Underflow, even
        if the result is subnormal and inexact.

    spec is a dictionary whose keys should include 'thousands_sep' and
    'grouping'; typically it's the result of parsing the format
    specifier using _parse_format_specifier.

    The min_width keyword argument gives the minimum length of the
    result, which will be padded on the left with zeros if necessary.

    If necessary, the zero padding adds an extra '0' on the left to
    avoid a leading thousands separator.  For example, inserting
    commas every three digits in '123456', with min_width=8, gives
    '0,123,456', even though that has length 9.

Functions:

alarm() -- cause SIGALRM after a specified time [Unix only]
setitimer() -- cause a signal (described below) after a specified
               float time and the timer may restart then [Unix only]
getitimer() -- get current value of timer [Unix only]
signal() -- set the action for a given signal
getsignal() -- get the signal action for a given signal
pause() -- wait until a signal arrives [Unix only]
default_int_handler() -- default SIGINT handler

signal constants:
SIG_DFL -- used to refer to the system default handler
SIG_IGN -- used to ignore the signal
NSIG -- number of defined signals
SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc. -- signal numbers

itimer constants:
ITIMER_REAL -- decrements in real time, and delivers SIGALRM upon
               expiration
ITIMER_VIRTUAL -- decrements only when the process is executing,
               and delivers SIGVTALRM upon expiration
ITIMER_PROF -- decrements both when the process is executing and
               when the system is executing on behalf of the process.
               Coupled with ITIMER_VIRTUAL, this timer is usually
               used to profile the time spent by the application
               in user and kernel space. SIGPROF is delivered upon
               expiration.

socket(family=-1, type=-1, proto=-1, fileno=None) -> socket object

Open a socket of the given type.  The family argument specifies the
address family; it defaults to AF_INET.  The type argument specifies
whether this is a stream (SOCK_STREAM, this is the default)
or datagram (SOCK_DGRAM) socket.  The protocol argument defaults to 0,
specifying the default protocol.  Keyword arguments are accepted.
The socket is created as non-inheritable.

When a fileno is passed in, family, type and proto are auto-detected,
unless they are explicitly set.

A socket object represents one endpoint of a network connection.

Methods of socket objects (keyword arguments not allowed):

_accept() -- accept connection, returning new socket fd and client address
bind(addr) -- bind the socket to a local address
close() -- close the socket
connect(addr) -- connect the socket to a remote address

'_statu'string helper module'formatter_field_name_splitformatter_parser_stringu'Create a compiled struct object.

Return a new Struct object which writes and reads binary data according to
the format string.

See help(struct) for more on format strings.'u'struct format string'u'Struct.format'iter_unpackpackpack_intou'struct size in bytes'u'Struct.size'unpackunpack_fromStructu'Functions to convert between Python values and C structs.
Python bytes objects are used to hold the data representing the C struct
and also as format strings (explained below) to describe the layout of data
in the C struct.

The optional first format char indicates byte order, size and alignment:
  @: native order, size & alignment (default)
  =: native order, std. size & alignment
  <: little-endian, std. size & alignment
  >: big-endian, std. size & alignment
  !: same as >

The remaining chars indicate types of args and must match exactly;
these can be preceded by a decimal repeat count:
  x: pad byte (no data); c:char; b:signed byte; B:unsigned byte;
  ?: _Bool (requires C99; if not available, char is used instead)
  h:short; H:unsigned short; i:int; I:unsigned int;
  l:long; L:unsigned long; f:float; d:double; e:half-float.
Special cases (preceding decimal count indicates length):
  s:string (array of char); p: pascal string (with count byte).
Special cases (only available in native format):
  n:ssize_t; N:size_t;
  P:an integer type that is wide enough to hold a pointer.
Special case (not in native mode unless 'long long' in platform C):
  q:long long; Q:unsigned long long
Whitespace between formats is ignored.

The variable struct.error is an exception raised on errors.

(Note that this module provides a Python version of the threading.local

 faster one available.  You should always import the `local` class from
 `threading`.)

Thread-local objects support the management of thread-local data.
If you have data that you want to be local to a thread, simply create
a thread-local object and use its attributes:

  >>> mydata = local()
  >>> mydata.number = 42
  >>> mydata.number
  42

You can also access the local-object's dictionary:

  >>> mydata.__dict__
  {'number': 42}
  >>> mydata.__dict__.setdefault('widgets', [])
  []
  >>> mydata.widgets
  []

What's important about thread-local objects is that their data are
local to a thread. If we access the data in a different thread:

  >>> log = []
  >>> def f():
  ...     items = sorted(mydata.__dict__.items())
  ...     log.append(items)
  ...     mydata.number = 11
  ...     log.append(mydata.number)

  >>> import threading
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()
  >>> log
  [[], 11]

we get different data.  Furthermore, changes made in the other thread
don't affect data seen in this thread:

  >>> mydata.number
  42

Of course, values you get from a local object, including a __dict__
attribute, are for whatever thread was current at the time the
attribute was read.  For that reason, you generally don't want to save
these values across threads, as they apply only to the thread they
came from.

You can create custom local objects by subclassing the local class:

  >>> class MyLocal(local):
  ...     number = 2
  ...     def __init__(self, /, **kw):
  ...         self.__dict__.update(kw)
  ...     def squared(self):
  ...         return self.number ** 2

This can be useful to support default values, methods and
initialization.  Note that if you define an __init__ method, it will be
called each time the local object is used in a separate thread.  This
is necessary to initialize each thread's dictionary.

Now if we create a local object:

  >>> mydata = MyLocal(color='red')

Now we have a default number:

  >>> mydata.number
  2

an initial color:

  >>> mydata.color
  'red'
  >>> del mydata.color

And a method that operates on the data:

  >>> mydata.squared()
  4

As before, we can access the data in a separate thread:

  >>> log = []
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()
  >>> log
  [[('color', 'red')], 11]

without affecting this thread's data:

  >>> mydata.number
  2
  >>> mydata.color
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AttributeError: 'MyLocal' object has no attribute 'color'

Note that subclasses can define slots, but they are not thread
local. They are shared across threads:

  >>> class MyLocal(local):
  ...     __slots__ = 'number'

  >>> mydata = MyLocal()
  >>> mydata.number = 42
  >>> mydata.color = 'red'

So, the separate thread:

  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()

affects what we see:

    Provides a general-case interface for Requests sessions to contact HTTP and
    HTTPS urls by implementing the Transport Adapter interface. This class will
    usually be created by the :class:`Session <Session>` class under the
    covers.

    :param pool_connections: The number of urllib3 connection pools to cache.
    :param pool_maxsize: The maximum number of connections to save in the pool.
    :param max_retries: The maximum number of retries each connection
        should attempt. Note, this applies only to failed DNS lookups, socket
        connections and connection timeouts, never to requests where data has
        made it to the server. By default, Requests does not retry failed
        connections. If you need granular control over the conditions under
        which we retry a request, import urllib3's ``Retry`` class and pass
        that instead.

'u'requests.adapters'u'adapters' Encoding Aliases Support

    This module is used by the encodings package search function to
    map encodings names to module names.

    Note that the search function normalizes the encoding names before
    doing the lookup, so the mapping will have to map normalized
    encoding names to module names.

    Contents:

        The following aliases dictionary contains mappings of all IANA
        character set names for which the Python core library provides
        codecs. In addition to these, a few Python specific codec

    This module is used by the encodings package search function to
    map encodings names to module names.

    Note that the search function normalizes the encoding names before
    doing the lookup, so the mapping will have to map normalized
    encoding names to module names.

        The following aliases dictionary contains mappings of all IANA
        character set names for which the Python core library provides
        codecs. In addition to these, a few Python specific codec
        aliases have also been added.

    Given a raw bytes sequence, return the best possibles charset usable to render str objects.
    If there is no results, it is a strong indicator that the source is binary/not text.
    By default, the process will extract 5 blocs of 512o each to assess the mess and coherence of a given sequence.
    And will give up a particular code page after 20% of measured mess. Those criteria are customizable at will.

    The preemptive behavior DOES NOT replace the traditional detection workflow, it prioritize a particular code page
    but never take it for granted. Can improve the performance.

    You may want to focus your attention to some code page or/and not others, use cp_isolation and cp_exclusion for that
    purpose.

    This function will strip the SIG in the payload/sequence every time except on UTF-16, UTF-32.
    By default the library does not setup any handler other than the NullHandler, if you choose to set the 'explain'
    toggle to True it will alter the logger configuration to add a StreamHandler that is suitable for debugging.
    Custom logging format and handler can be set manually.

    Given a raw bytes sequence, return the best possibles charset usable to render str objects.
    If there is no results, it is a strong indicator that the source is binary/not text.
    By default, the process will extract 5 blocs of 512o each to assess the mess and coherence of a given sequence.
    And will give up a particular code page after 20% of measured mess. Those criteria are customizable at will.

    The preemptive behavior DOES NOT replace the traditional detection workflow, it prioritize a particular code page
    but never take it for granted. Can improve the performance.

    You may want to focus your attention to some code page or/and not others, use cp_isolation and cp_exclusion for that
    purpose.

    This function will strip the SIG in the payload/sequence every time except on UTF-16, UTF-32.
    By default the library does not setup any handler other than the NullHandler, if you choose to set the 'explain'
    toggle to True it will alter the logger configuration to add a StreamHandler that is suitable for debugging.
    Custom logging format and handler can be set manually.

This module is an optparse-inspired command-line parsing library that:

    - handles both optional and positional arguments
    - produces highly informative usage messages
    - supports parsers that dispatch to sub-parsers

The following is a simple usage example that sums integers from the
command-line and writes the result to a file::

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='sum the integers at the command line')
    parser.add_argument(
        'integers', metavar='int', nargs='+', type=int,
        help='an integer to be summed')
    parser.add_argument(
        '--log', default=sys.stdout, type=argparse.FileType('w'),
        help='the file where the sum should be written')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    args.log.write('%s' % sum(args.integers))
    args.log.close()

The module contains the following public classes:

    - ArgumentParser -- The main entry point for command-line parsing. As the
        example above shows, the add_argument() method is used to populate
        the parser with actions for optional and positional arguments. Then
        the parse_args() method is invoked to convert the args at the
        command-line into an object with attributes.

    - ArgumentError -- The exception raised by ArgumentParser objects when
        there are errors with the parser's actions. Errors raised while
        parsing the command-line are caught by ArgumentParser and emitted
        as command-line messages.

    - FileType -- A factory for defining types of files to be created. As the
        example above shows, instances of FileType are typically passed as
        the type= argument of add_argument() calls.

    - Action -- The base class for parser actions. Typically actions are
        selected by passing strings like 'store_true' or 'append_const' to
        the action= argument of add_argument(). However, for greater
        customization of ArgumentParser actions, subclasses of Action may
        be defined and passed as the action= argument.

    - HelpFormatter, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter, RawTextHelpFormatter,
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter -- Formatter classes which
        may be passed as the formatter_class= argument to the
        ArgumentParser constructor. HelpFormatter is the default,
        RawDescriptionHelpFormatter and RawTextHelpFormatter tell the parser
        not to change the formatting for help text, and
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter adds information about argument defaults
        to the help.

All other classes in this module are considered implementation details.
(Also note that HelpFormatter and RawDescriptionHelpFormatter are only
considered public as object names -- the API of the formatter objects is
still considered an implementation detail.)

    Action objects are used by an ArgumentParser to represent the information
    needed to parse a single argument from one or more strings from the
    command line. The keyword arguments to the Action constructor are also
    all attributes of Action instances.

    Keyword Arguments:

        - option_strings -- A list of command-line option strings which
            should be associated with this action.

        - dest -- The name of the attribute to hold the created object(s)

        - nargs -- The number of command-line arguments that should be
            consumed. By default, one argument will be consumed and a single
            value will be produced.  Other values include:
                - N (an integer) consumes N arguments (and produces a list)
                - '?' consumes zero or one arguments
                - '*' consumes zero or more arguments (and produces a list)
                - '+' consumes one or more arguments (and produces a list)
            Note that the difference between the default and nargs=1 is that
            with the default, a single value will be produced, while with
            nargs=1, a list containing a single value will be produced.

        - const -- The value to be produced if the option is specified and the
            option uses an action that takes no values.

        - default -- The value to be produced if the option is not specified.

        - type -- A callable that accepts a single string argument, and
            returns the converted value.  The standard Python types str, int,
            float, and complex are useful examples of such callables.  If None,
            str is used.

        - choices -- A container of values that should be allowed. If not None,
            after a command-line argument has been converted to the appropriate
            type, an exception will be raised if it is not a member of this
            collection.

        - required -- True if the action must always be specified at the
            command line. This is only meaningful for optional command-line
            arguments.

        - help -- The help string describing the argument.

        - metavar -- The name to be used for the option's argument with the
            help string. If None, the 'dest' value will be used as the name.

    Instances of FileType are typically passed as type= arguments to the
    ArgumentParser add_argument() method.

    Keyword Arguments:
        - mode -- A string indicating how the file is to be opened. Accepts the
            same values as the builtin open() function.
        - bufsize -- The file's desired buffer size. Accepts the same values as
            the builtin open() function.
        - encoding -- The file's encoding. Accepts the same values as the
            builtin open() function.
        - errors -- A string indicating how encoding and decoding errors are to
            be handled. Accepts the same value as the builtin open() function.

This module is an optparse-inspired command-line parsing library that:

    - handles both optional and positional arguments
    - produces highly informative usage messages
    - supports parsers that dispatch to sub-parsers

The following is a simple usage example that sums integers from the
command-line and writes the result to a file::

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='sum the integers at the command line')
    parser.add_argument(
        'integers', metavar='int', nargs='+', type=int,
        help='an integer to be summed')
    parser.add_argument(
        '--log', default=sys.stdout, type=argparse.FileType('w'),
        help='the file where the sum should be written')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    args.log.write('%s' % sum(args.integers))
    args.log.close()

The module contains the following public classes:

    - ArgumentParser -- The main entry point for command-line parsing. As the
        example above shows, the add_argument() method is used to populate
        the parser with actions for optional and positional arguments. Then
        the parse_args() method is invoked to convert the args at the
        command-line into an object with attributes.

    - ArgumentError -- The exception raised by ArgumentParser objects when
        there are errors with the parser's actions. Errors raised while
        parsing the command-line are caught by ArgumentParser and emitted
        as command-line messages.

    - FileType -- A factory for defining types of files to be created. As the
        example above shows, instances of FileType are typically passed as
        the type= argument of add_argument() calls.

    - Action -- The base class for parser actions. Typically actions are
        selected by passing strings like 'store_true' or 'append_const' to
        the action= argument of add_argument(). However, for greater
        customization of ArgumentParser actions, subclasses of Action may
        be defined and passed as the action= argument.

    - HelpFormatter, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter, RawTextHelpFormatter,
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter -- Formatter classes which
        may be passed as the formatter_class= argument to the
        ArgumentParser constructor. HelpFormatter is the default,
        RawDescriptionHelpFormatter and RawTextHelpFormatter tell the parser
        not to change the formatting for help text, and
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter adds information about argument defaults
        to the help.

'u'Command-line parsing library

This module is an optparse-inspired command-line parsing library that:

    - handles both optional and positional arguments
    - produces highly informative usage messages
    - supports parsers that dispatch to sub-parsers

The following is a simple usage example that sums integers from the
command-line and writes the result to a file::

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='sum the integers at the command line')
    parser.add_argument(
        'integers', metavar='int', nargs='+', type=int,
        help='an integer to be summed')
    parser.add_argument(
        '--log', default=sys.stdout, type=argparse.FileType('w'),
        help='the file where the sum should be written')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    args.log.write('%s' % sum(args.integers))
    args.log.close()

The module contains the following public classes:

    - ArgumentParser -- The main entry point for command-line parsing. As the
        example above shows, the add_argument() method is used to populate
        the parser with actions for optional and positional arguments. Then
        the parse_args() method is invoked to convert the args at the
        command-line into an object with attributes.

    - ArgumentError -- The exception raised by ArgumentParser objects when
        there are errors with the parser's actions. Errors raised while
        parsing the command-line are caught by ArgumentParser and emitted
        as command-line messages.

    - FileType -- A factory for defining types of files to be created. As the
        example above shows, instances of FileType are typically passed as
        the type= argument of add_argument() calls.

    - Action -- The base class for parser actions. Typically actions are
        selected by passing strings like 'store_true' or 'append_const' to
        the action= argument of add_argument(). However, for greater
        customization of ArgumentParser actions, subclasses of Action may
        be defined and passed as the action= argument.

    - HelpFormatter, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter, RawTextHelpFormatter,
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter -- Formatter classes which
        may be passed as the formatter_class= argument to the
        ArgumentParser constructor. HelpFormatter is the default,
        RawDescriptionHelpFormatter and RawTextHelpFormatter tell the parser
        not to change the formatting for help text, and
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter adds information about argument defaults
        to the help.

All other classes in this module are considered implementation details.
(Also note that HelpFormatter and RawDescriptionHelpFormatter are only
considered public as object names -- the API of the formatter objects is
still considered an implementation detail.)

    Action objects are used by an ArgumentParser to represent the information
    needed to parse a single argument from one or more strings from the
    command line. The keyword arguments to the Action constructor are also
    all attributes of Action instances.

    Keyword Arguments:

        - option_strings -- A list of command-line option strings which
            should be associated with this action.

        - dest -- The name of the attribute to hold the created object(s)

        - nargs -- The number of command-line arguments that should be
            consumed. By default, one argument will be consumed and a single
            value will be produced.  Other values include:
                - N (an integer) consumes N arguments (and produces a list)
                - '?' consumes zero or one arguments
                - '*' consumes zero or more arguments (and produces a list)
                - '+' consumes one or more arguments (and produces a list)
            Note that the difference between the default and nargs=1 is that
            with the default, a single value will be produced, while with
            nargs=1, a list containing a single value will be produced.

        - const -- The value to be produced if the option is specified and the
            option uses an action that takes no values.

        - default -- The value to be produced if the option is not specified.

        - type -- A callable that accepts a single string argument, and
            returns the converted value.  The standard Python types str, int,
            float, and complex are useful examples of such callables.  If None,
            str is used.

        - choices -- A container of values that should be allowed. If not None,
            after a command-line argument has been converted to the appropriate
            type, an exception will be raised if it is not a member of this
            collection.

        - required -- True if the action must always be specified at the
            command line. This is only meaningful for optional command-line
            arguments.

        - help -- The help string describing the argument.

        - metavar -- The name to be used for the option's argument with the
            help string. If None, the 'dest' value will be used as the name.

'u'argparse'u'array(typecode [, initializer]) -> array

Return a new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and
initialized from the optional initializer value, which must be a list,
string or iterable over elements of the appropriate type.

Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except
the type of objects stored in them is constrained. The type is specified
at object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character.
The following type codes are defined:

    Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes
    'b'         signed integer     1
    'B'         unsigned integer   1
    'u'         Unicode character  2 (see note)
    'h'         signed integer     2
    'H'         unsigned integer   2
    'i'         signed integer     2
    'I'         unsigned integer   2
    'l'         signed integer     4
    'L'         unsigned integer   4
    'q'         signed integer     8 (see note)
    'Q'         unsigned integer   8 (see note)
    'f'         floating point     4
    'd'         floating point     8

NOTE: The 'u' typecode corresponds to Python's unicode character. On
narrow builds this is 2-bytes on wide builds this is 4-bytes.

NOTE: The 'q' and 'Q' type codes are only available if the platform
C compiler used to build Python supports 'long long', or, on Windows,
'__int64'.

Methods:

append() -- append a new item to the end of the array
buffer_info() -- return information giving the current memory info
byteswap() -- byteswap all the items of the array
count() -- return number of occurrences of an object
extend() -- extend array by appending multiple elements from an iterable
fromfile() -- read items from a file object
fromlist() -- append items from the list
frombytes() -- append items from the string
index() -- return index of first occurrence of an object
insert() -- insert a new item into the array at a provided position
pop() -- remove and return item (default last)
remove() -- remove first occurrence of an object
reverse() -- reverse the order of the items in the array
tofile() -- write all items to a file object
tolist() -- return the array converted to an ordinary list
tobytes() -- return the array converted to a string

    ast
    ~~~

    The `ast` module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python
    abstract syntax grammar.  The abstract syntax itself might change with
    each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what
    the current grammar looks like and allows modifications of it.

    An abstract syntax tree can be generated by passing `ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST` as
    a flag to the `compile()` builtin function or by using the `parse()`
    function from this module.  The result will be a tree of objects whose
    classes all inherit from `ast.AST`.

    A modified abstract syntax tree can be compiled into a Python code object
    using the built-in `compile()` function.

    Additionally various helper functions are provided that make working with
    the trees simpler.  The main intention of the helper functions and this
    module in general is to provide an easy to use interface for libraries
    that work tightly with the python syntax (template engines for example).

type_commentsfeature_version
    Parse the source into an AST node.
    Equivalent to compile(source, filename, mode, PyCF_ONLY_AST).
    Pass type_comments=True to get back type comments where the syntax allows.
    _feature_versionliteral_evalnode_or_string
    Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python
    expression.  The string or node provided may only consist of the following
    Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts,
    sets, booleans, and None.
    _raise_malformed_nodenodemalformed node or string: _convert_num_convert_signed_numoperand_converteltsleftrightannotate_fieldsinclude_attributes
    Return a formatted dump of the tree in node.  This is mainly useful for
    debugging purposes.  If annotate_fields is true (by default),
    the returned string will show the names and the values for fields.
    If annotate_fields is false, the result string will be more compact by
    omitting unambiguous field names.  Attributes such as line
    numbers and column offsets are not dumped by default.  If this is wanted,
    include_attributes can be set to true.
    %s=%sexpected AST, got %rcopy_locationnew_nodeold_node
    Copy source location (`lineno`, `col_offset`, `end_lineno`, and `end_col_offset`
    attributes) from *old_node* to *new_node* if possible, and return *new_node*.
    col_offsetend_linenoend_col_offsetend_fix_missing_locations
    When you compile a node tree with compile(), the compiler expects lineno and
    col_offset attributes for every node that supports them.  This is rather
    tedious to fill in for generated nodes, so this helper adds these attributes
    recursively where not already set, by setting them to the values of the
    parent node.  It works recursively starting at *node*.
    childiter_child_nodesincrement_lineno
    Increment the line number and end line number of each node in the tree
    starting at *node* by *n*. This is useful to "move code" to a different
    location in a file.
    iter_fields
    Yield a tuple of ``(fieldname, value)`` for each field in ``node._fields``
    that is present on *node*.
    
    Yield all direct child nodes of *node*, that is, all fields that are nodes
    and all items of fields that are lists of nodes.
    get_docstringclean
    Return the docstring for the given node or None if no docstring can
    be found.  If the node provided does not have docstrings a TypeError
    will be raised.

    If *clean* is `True`, all tabs are expanded to spaces and any whitespace
    that can be uniformly removed from the second line onwards is removed.
    %r can't have docstringsStrcleandoc_splitlines_no_ffSplit a string into lines ignoring form feed and other chars.

    This mimics how the Python parser splits source code.
    next_line_pad_whitespaceReplace all chars except '\f\t' in a line with spaces.	get_source_segmentpaddedGet source code segment of the *source* that generated *node*.

    If some location information (`lineno`, `end_lineno`, `col_offset`,
    or `end_col_offset`) is missing, return None.

    If *padded* is `True`, the first line of a multi-line statement will
    be padded with spaces to match its original position.
    
    Recursively yield all descendant nodes in the tree starting at *node*
    (including *node* itself), in no specified order.  This is useful if you
    only want to modify nodes in place and don't care about the context.
    todoNodeVisitor
    A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls a
    visitor function for every node found.  This function may return a value
    which is forwarded by the `visit` method.

    This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor
    methods.

    Per default the visitor functions for the nodes are ``'visit_'`` +
    class name of the node.  So a `TryFinally` node visit function would
    be `visit_TryFinally`.  This behavior can be changed by overriding
    the `visit` method.  If no visitor function exists for a node
    (return value `None`) the `generic_visit` visitor is used instead.

    Don't use the `NodeVisitor` if you want to apply changes to nodes during
    traversing.  For this a special visitor exists (`NodeTransformer`) that
    allows modifications.
    visitVisit a node.visit_generic_visitvisitorCalled if no explicit visitor function exists for a node.visit_Constant_const_node_type_names is deprecated; add visit_ConstantNodeTransformer
    A :class:`NodeVisitor` subclass that walks the abstract syntax tree and
    allows modification of nodes.

    The `NodeTransformer` will walk the AST and use the return value of the
    visitor methods to replace or remove the old node.  If the return value of
    the visitor method is ``None``, the node will be removed from its location,
    otherwise it is replaced with the return value.  The return value may be the
    original node in which case no replacement takes place.

    Here is an example transformer that rewrites all occurrences of name lookups
    (``foo``) to ``data['foo']``::

       class RewriteName(NodeTransformer):

           def visit_Name(self, node):
               return Subscript(
                   value=Name(id='data', ctx=Load()),
                   slice=Index(value=Str(s=node.id)),
                   ctx=node.ctx
               )

    Keep in mind that if the node you're operating on has child nodes you must
    either transform the child nodes yourself or call the :meth:`generic_visit`
    method for the node first.

    For nodes that were part of a collection of statements (that applies to all
    statement nodes), the visitor may also return a list of nodes rather than
    just a single node.

    Usually you use the transformer like this::

       node = YourTransformer().visit(node)
    new_values_getter_setter_ABC_const_types_const_types_not_new got multiple values for argument NumBytesNameConstant# Should be a 2-tuple.# Else it should be an int giving the minor version for 3.x.# end_lineno and end_col_offset are optional attributes, and they# should be copied whether the value is None or not.# Keep \r\n together# The following code is for backward compatibility.# It will be removed in future.# arbitrary keyword arguments are accepted# should be before intb'
    ast
    ~~~

    The `ast` module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python
    abstract syntax grammar.  The abstract syntax itself might change with
    each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what
    the current grammar looks like and allows modifications of it.

    An abstract syntax tree can be generated by passing `ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST` as
    a flag to the `compile()` builtin function or by using the `parse()`
    function from this module.  The result will be a tree of objects whose
    classes all inherit from `ast.AST`.

    A modified abstract syntax tree can be compiled into a Python code object
    using the built-in `compile()` function.

    Additionally various helper functions are provided that make working with
    the trees simpler.  The main intention of the helper functions and this
    module in general is to provide an easy to use interface for libraries
    that work tightly with the python syntax (template engines for example).

This module handles the content transfer encoding method defined in RFC 2045
to encode arbitrary 8-bit data using the three 8-bit bytes in four 7-bit
characters encoding known as Base64.

It is used in the MIME standards for email to attach images, audio, and text
using some 8-bit character sets to messages.

This module provides an interface to encode and decode both headers and bodies
with Base64 encoding.

RFC 2045 defines a method for including character set information in an
`encoded-word' in a header.  This method is commonly used for 8-bit real names
in To:, From:, Cc:, etc. fields, as well as Subject: lines.

This module does not do the line wrapping or end-of-line character conversion
necessary for proper internationalized headers; it only does dumb encoding and
decoding.  To deal with the various line wrapping issues, use the email.header

The event loop can be broken up into a multiplexer (the part
responsible for notifying us of I/O events) and the event loop proper,
which wraps a multiplexer with functionality for scheduling callbacks,
immediately or at a given time in the future.

Whenever a public API takes a callback, subsequent positional
arguments will be passed to the callback if/when it is called.  This
avoids the proliferation of trivial lambdas implementing closures.
Keyword arguments for the callback are not supported; this is a
conscious design decision, leaving the door open for keyword arguments
to modify the meaning of the API call itself.

The event loop can be broken up into a multiplexer (the part
responsible for notifying us of I/O events) and the event loop proper,
which wraps a multiplexer with functionality for scheduling callbacks,
immediately or at a given time in the future.

Whenever a public API takes a callback, subsequent positional
arguments will be passed to the callback if/when it is called.  This
avoids the proliferation of trivial lambdas implementing closures.
Keyword arguments for the callback are not supported; this is a
conscious design decision, leaving the door open for keyword arguments
to modify the meaning of the API call itself.

    This class takes care of details of the trace facility;
    a derived class should implement user interaction.
    The standard debugger class (pdb.Pdb) is an example.

    The optional skip argument must be an iterable of glob-style
    module name patterns.  The debugger will not step into frames
    that originate in a module that matches one of these patterns.
    Whether a frame is considered to originate in a certain module
    is determined by the __name__ in the frame globals.
    breaksfncacheframe_returningcanonicReturn canonical form of filename.

        For real filenames, the canonical form is a case-normalized (on
        case insensitive filesystems) absolute path.  'Filenames' with
        angle brackets, such as "<stdin>", generated in interactive
        mode, are returned unchanged.
        Set values of attributes as ready to start debugging.botframe_set_stopinfotrace_dispatchDispatch a trace function for debugged frames based on the event.

        This function is installed as the trace function for debugged
        frames. Its return value is the new trace function, which is
        usually itself. The default implementation decides how to
        dispatch a frame, depending on the type of event (passed in as a
        string) that is about to be executed.

        The event can be one of the following:
            line: A new line of code is going to be executed.
            call: A function is about to be called or another code block
                  is entered.
            return: A function or other code block is about to return.
            exception: An exception has occurred.
            c_call: A C function is about to be called.
            c_return: A C function has returned.
            c_exception: A C function has raised an exception.

        For the Python events, specialized functions (see the dispatch_*()
        methods) are called.  For the C events, no action is taken.

        The arg parameter depends on the previous event.

    Implements temporary breakpoints, ignore counts, disabling and
    (re)-enabling, and conditionals.

    Breakpoints are indexed by number through bpbynumber and by
    the (file, line) tuple using bplist.  The former points to a
    single instance of class Breakpoint.  The latter points to a
    list of such instances since there may be more than one
    breakpoint per line.

    When creating a breakpoint, its associated filename should be
    in canonical form.  If funcname is defined, a breakpoint hit will be
    counted when the first line of that function is executed.  A
    conditional breakpoint always counts a hit.
    func_first_executable_lineDelete the breakpoint from the list associated to a file:line.

        If it is the last breakpoint in that position, it also deletes
        the entry for the file:line.
        Mark the breakpoint as enabled.Mark the breakpoint as disabled.bpprintPrint the output of bpformat().

        The optional out argument directs where the output is sent
        and defaults to standard output.
        bpformatReturn a string with information about the breakpoint.

        The information includes the breakpoint number, temporary
        status, file:line position, break condition, number of times to
        ignore, and number of times hit.

        del  dispkeep yes  no   %-4dbreakpoint   %s at %s:%d
	stop only if %s
	ignore next %d hitsss
	breakpoint already hit %d time%sReturn a condensed description of the breakpoint.breakpoint %s at %s:%scheckfuncnameReturn True if break should happen here.

    Whether a break should happen depends on the way that b (the breakpoint)
    was set.  If it was set via line number, check if b.line is the same as
    the one in the frame.  If it was set via function name, check if this is
    the right function and if it is on the first executable line.
    Determine which breakpoint for this file:line is to be acted upon.

    Called only if we know there is a breakpoint at this location.  Return
    the breakpoint that was triggered and a boolean that indicates if it is
    ok to delete a temporary breakpoint.  Return (None, None) if there is no
    matching breakpoint.

BZ2FileNadeem Vawda <nadeem.vawda@gmail.com>_builtin_open_compression_MODE_CLOSED_MODE_READ_MODE_WRITE_sentinelA file object providing transparent bzip2 (de)compression.

    A BZ2File can act as a wrapper for an existing file object, or refer
    directly to a named file on disk.

    Note that BZ2File provides a *binary* file interface - data read is
    returned as bytes, and data to be written should be given as bytes.
    bufferingcompresslevelOpen a bzip2-compressed file.

        If filename is a str, bytes, or PathLike object, it gives the
        name of the file to be opened. Otherwise, it should be a file
        object, which will be used to read or write the compressed data.

        mode can be 'r' for reading (default), 'w' for (over)writing,
        'x' for creating exclusively, or 'a' for appending. These can
        equivalently be given as 'rb', 'wb', 'xb', and 'ab'.

        buffering is ignored since Python 3.0. Its use is deprecated.

        If mode is 'w', 'x' or 'a', compresslevel can be a number between 1
        and 9 specifying the level of compression: 1 produces the least
        compression, and 9 (default) produces the most compression.

        If mode is 'r', the input file may be the concatenation of
        multiple compressed streams.

        Returns b'' if the file is already at EOF.
        Read up to size uncompressed bytes, while trying to avoid

        Read bytes into b.

        Returns the number of bytes read (0 for EOF).
        Read a line of uncompressed bytes from the file.

        The terminating newline (if present) is retained. If size is
        non-negative, no more than size bytes will be read (in which
        case the line may be incomplete). Returns b'' if already at EOF.
        Integer argument expectedRead a list of lines of uncompressed bytes from the file.

        size can be specified to control the number of lines read: no
        further lines will be read once the total size of the lines read
        so far equals or exceeds size.
        Write a byte string to the file.

        Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, which is
        always len(data). Note that due to buffering, the file on disk
        may not reflect the data written until close() is called.
        compressedWrite a sequence of byte strings to the file.

        Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written.
        seq can be any iterable yielding byte strings.

        Line separators are not added between the written byte strings.
        Change the file position.

        The new position is specified by offset, relative to the
        position indicated by whence. Values for whence are:

            0: start of stream (default); offset must not be negative
            1: current stream position
            2: end of stream; offset must not be positive

        Returns the new file position.

        Note that seeking is emulated, so depending on the parameters,
        this operation may be extremely slow.
        Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary or text mode.

    The filename argument can be an actual filename (a str, bytes, or
    PathLike object), or an existing file object to read from or write
    to.

    The mode argument can be "r", "rb", "w", "wb", "x", "xb", "a" or
    "ab" for binary mode, or "rt", "wt", "xt" or "at" for text mode.
    The default mode is "rb", and the default compresslevel is 9.

    For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the BZ2File
    constructor: BZ2File(filename, mode, compresslevel). In this case,
    the encoding, errors and newline arguments must not be provided.

    For text mode, a BZ2File object is created, and wrapped in an
    io.TextIOWrapper instance with the specified encoding, error
    handling behavior, and line ending(s).

    Argument 'encoding' not supported in binary modeArgument 'errors' not supported in binary modeArgument 'newline' not supported in binary modebz_modebinary_fileCompress a block of data.

    compresslevel, if given, must be a number between 1 and 9.

    By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
    'runTest'.

    If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
    many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
    subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
    that the instance is to execute.

    Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
    and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
    implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.

    If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
    __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
    should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
    of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
    in order to be run.

    When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
    * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
        the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
        exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
    * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
        objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
        to any explicit message passed.
    * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
        by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
        attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.
    longMessagemaxDiff_diffThreshold_classSetupFailed_class_cleanupsCreate an instance of the class that will use the named test
           method when executed. Raises a ValueError if the instance does

        This method is for use by TestCase subclasses that need to register
        their own type equality functions to provide nicer error messages.

        Args:
            typeobj: The data type to call this function on when both values
                    are of the same type in assertEqual().
            function: The callable taking two arguments and an optional
                    msg= argument that raises self.failureException with a
                    useful error message when the two arguments are not equal.
        Add a function, with arguments, to be called when the test is
        completed. Functions added are called on a LIFO basis and are
        called after tearDown on test failure or success.

        Cleanup items are called even if setUp fails (unlike tearDown).descriptor 'addCleanup' of 'TestCase' object needs an argument"descriptor 'addCleanup' of 'TestCase' object "Passing 'function' as keyword argument is deprecatedaddCleanup expected at least 1 positional argument, got %d'addCleanup expected at least 1 positional ''argument, got %d'($self, function, /, *args, **kwargs)addClassCleanupSame as addCleanup, except the cleanup items are called even if

        If longMessage is False this means:
        * Use only an explicit message if it is provided
        * Otherwise use the standard message for the assert

        If longMessage is True:
        * Use the standard message
        * If an explicit message is provided, plus ' : ' and the explicit message
        %s : %sexpected_exceptionFail unless an exception of class expected_exception is raised
           by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
           keyword arguments. If a different type of exception is
           raised, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
           deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
           unexpected exception.

           If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
           context object used like this::

                with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
                    do_something()

           An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertRaises
           is used as a context object.

           The context manager keeps a reference to the exception as
           the 'exception' attribute. This allows you to inspect the
           exception after the assertion::

               with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
                   do_something()
               the_exception = cm.exception
               self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)
        assertWarnsexpected_warningFail unless a warning of class warnClass is triggered
           by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
           keyword arguments.  If a different type of warning is
           triggered, it will not be handled: depending on the other
           warning filtering rules in effect, it might be silenced, printed
           out, or raised as an exception.

           If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
           context object used like this::

                with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
                    do_something()

           An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertWarns
           is used as a context object.

           The context manager keeps a reference to the first matching
           warning as the 'warning' attribute; similarly, the 'filename'
           and 'lineno' attributes give you information about the line
           of Python code from which the warning was triggered.
           This allows you to inspect the warning after the assertion::

               with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
                   do_something()
               the_warning = cm.warning
               self.assertEqual(the_warning.some_attribute, 147)
        assertLogsFail unless a log message of level *level* or higher is emitted
        on *logger_name* or its children.  If omitted, *level* defaults to
        INFO and *logger* defaults to the root logger.

        This method must be used as a context manager, and will yield
        a recording object with two attributes: `output` and `records`.
        At the end of the context manager, the `output` attribute will
        be a list of the matching formatted log messages and the
        `records` attribute will be a list of the corresponding LogRecord
        objects.

        Example::

            with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
                logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
                logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
            self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
                                         'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])
        _getAssertEqualityFuncGet a detailed comparison function for the types of the two args.

        Returns: A callable accepting (first, second, msg=None) that will
        raise a failure exception if first != second with a useful human
        readable error message for those types.

    By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
    'runTest'.

    If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
    many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
    subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
    that the instance is to execute.

    Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
    and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
    implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.

    If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
    __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
    should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
    of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
    in order to be run.

    When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
    * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
        the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
        exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
    * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
        objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
        to any explicit message passed.
    * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
        by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
        attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.

Contains CCompiler, an abstract base class that defines the interface
for the Distutils compiler abstraction model.distutils.errorsdistutils.spawndistutils.file_utilmove_filedistutils.dir_utilmkpathdistutils.dep_utilnewer_pairwisenewer_groupdistutils.utilsplit_quotedexecuteCCompilerAbstract base class to define the interface that must be implemented
    by real compiler classes.  Also has some utility methods used by
    several compiler classes.

    The basic idea behind a compiler abstraction class is that each
    instance can be used for all the compile/link steps in building a
    single project.  Thus, attributes common to all of those compile and
    link steps -- include directories, macros to define, libraries to link
    against, etc. -- are attributes of the compiler instance.  To allow for
    variability in how individual files are treated, most of those
    attributes may be varied on a per-compilation or per-link basis.
    compiler_typesrc_extensionsobj_extensionstatic_lib_extensionshared_lib_extensionstatic_lib_formatshared_lib_formatexe_extension.cc++.cc.cpp.cxxobjc.mlanguage_maplanguage_orderoutput_dirmacrosinclude_dirslibrarieslibrary_dirsruntime_library_dirsset_executableset_executablesDefine the executables (and options for them) that will be run
        to perform the various stages of compilation.  The exact set of
        executables that may be specified here depends on the compiler
        class (via the 'executables' class attribute), but most will have:
          compiler      the C/C++ compiler
          linker_so     linker used to create shared objects and libraries
          linker_exe    linker used to create binary executables
          archiver      static library creator

        On platforms with a command-line (Unix, DOS/Windows), each of these
        is a string that will be split into executable name and (optional)
        list of arguments.  (Splitting the string is done similarly to how
        Unix shells operate: words are delimited by spaces, but quotes and
        backslashes can override this.  See
        'distutils.util.split_quoted()'.)
        unknown executable '%s' for class %s_find_macrodefn_check_macro_definitionsdefinitionsEnsures that every element of 'definitions' is a valid macro
        definition, ie. either (name,value) 2-tuple or a (name,) tuple.  Do
        nothing if all definitions are OK, raise TypeError otherwise.
        invalid macro definition '%s': must be tuple (string,), (string, string), or (string, None)define_macroDefine a preprocessor macro for all compilations driven by this
        compiler object.  The optional parameter 'value' should be a
        string; if it is not supplied, then the macro will be defined
        without an explicit value and the exact outcome depends on the
        compiler used (XXX true? does ANSI say anything about this?)
        undefine_macroUndefine a preprocessor macro for all compilations driven by
        this compiler object.  If the same macro is defined by
        'define_macro()' and undefined by 'undefine_macro()' the last call
        takes precedence (including multiple redefinitions or
        undefinitions).  If the macro is redefined/undefined on a
        per-compilation basis (ie. in the call to 'compile()'), then that
        takes precedence.
        undefnadd_include_dirAdd 'dir' to the list of directories that will be searched for
        header files.  The compiler is instructed to search directories in
        the order in which they are supplied by successive calls to
        'add_include_dir()'.
        set_include_dirsdirsSet the list of directories that will be searched to 'dirs' (a
        list of strings).  Overrides any preceding calls to
        'add_include_dir()'; subsequence calls to 'add_include_dir()' add
        to the list passed to 'set_include_dirs()'.  This does not affect
        any list of standard include directories that the compiler may
        search by default.
        add_libraryAdd 'libname' to the list of libraries that will be included in
        all links driven by this compiler object.  Note that 'libname'
        should *not* be the name of a file containing a library, but the
        name of the library itself: the actual filename will be inferred by
        the linker, the compiler, or the compiler class (depending on the
        platform).

        The linker will be instructed to link against libraries in the
        order they were supplied to 'add_library()' and/or
        'set_libraries()'.  It is perfectly valid to duplicate library
        names; the linker will be instructed to link against libraries as
        many times as they are mentioned.
        set_librariesSet the list of libraries to be included in all links driven by
        this compiler object to 'libnames' (a list of strings).  This does
        not affect any standard system libraries that the linker may
        include by default.
        add_library_dirAdd 'dir' to the list of directories that will be searched for
        libraries specified to 'add_library()' and 'set_libraries()'.  The
        linker will be instructed to search for libraries in the order they
        are supplied to 'add_library_dir()' and/or 'set_library_dirs()'.
        set_library_dirsSet the list of library search directories to 'dirs' (a list of
        strings).  This does not affect any standard library search path
        that the linker may search by default.
        add_runtime_library_dirAdd 'dir' to the list of directories that will be searched for
        shared libraries at runtime.
        set_runtime_library_dirsSet the list of directories to search for shared libraries at
        runtime to 'dirs' (a list of strings).  This does not affect any
        standard search path that the runtime linker may search by
        default.
        add_link_objectAdd 'object' to the list of object files (or analogues, such as
        explicitly named library files or the output of "resource
        compilers") to be included in every link driven by this compiler
        object.
        set_link_objectsSet the list of object files (or analogues) to be included in
        every link to 'objects'.  This does not affect any standard object
        files that the linker may include by default (such as system
        libraries).

        Output will be written to file named 'output_file', or stdout if
        'output_file' not supplied.  'macros' is a list of macro
        definitions as for 'compile()', which will augment the macros set
        with 'define_macro()' and 'undefine_macro()'.  'include_dirs' is a
        list of directory names that will be added to the default list.

        Raises PreprocessError on failure.
        Compile one or more source files.

        'sources' must be a list of filenames, most likely C/C++
        files, but in reality anything that can be handled by a
        particular compiler and compiler class (eg. MSVCCompiler can
        handle resource files in 'sources').  Return a list of object
        filenames, one per source filename in 'sources'.  Depending on
        the implementation, not all source files will necessarily be
        compiled, but all corresponding object filenames will be
        returned.

        If 'output_dir' is given, object files will be put under it, while
        retaining their original path component.  That is, "foo/bar.c"
        normally compiles to "foo/bar.o" (for a Unix implementation); if
        'output_dir' is "build", then it would compile to
        "build/foo/bar.o".

        'macros', if given, must be a list of macro definitions.  A macro
        definition is either a (name, value) 2-tuple or a (name,) 1-tuple.
        The former defines a macro; if the value is None, the macro is
        defined without an explicit value.  The 1-tuple case undefines a
        macro.  Later definitions/redefinitions/ undefinitions take
        precedence.

        'include_dirs', if given, must be a list of strings, the
        directories to add to the default include file search path for this
        compilation only.

        'debug' is a boolean; if true, the compiler will be instructed to
        output debug symbols in (or alongside) the object file(s).

        'extra_preargs' and 'extra_postargs' are implementation- dependent.
        On platforms that have the notion of a command-line (e.g. Unix,
        DOS/Windows), they are most likely lists of strings: extra
        command-line arguments to prepend/append to the compiler command
        line.  On other platforms, consult the implementation class
        documentation.  In any event, they are intended as an escape hatch
        for those occasions when the abstract compiler framework doesn't
        cut the mustard.

        'depends', if given, is a list of filenames that all targets
        depend on.  If a source file is older than any file in
        depends, then the source file will be recompiled.  This
        supports dependency tracking, but only at a coarse
        granularity.

        Raises CompileError on failure.
        _compileCompile 'src' to product 'obj'.create_static_liboutput_libnametarget_langLink a bunch of stuff together to create a static library file.
        The "bunch of stuff" consists of the list of object files supplied
        as 'objects', the extra object files supplied to
        'add_link_object()' and/or 'set_link_objects()', the libraries
        supplied to 'add_library()' and/or 'set_libraries()', and the
        libraries supplied as 'libraries' (if any).

        'output_libname' should be a library name, not a filename; the
        filename will be inferred from the library name.  'output_dir' is
        the directory where the library file will be put.

        'debug' is a boolean; if true, debugging information will be
        included in the library (note that on most platforms, it is the
        compile step where this matters: the 'debug' flag is included here
        just for consistency).

        'target_lang' is the target language for which the given objects
        are being compiled. This allows specific linkage time treatment of
        certain languages.

        Raises LibError on failure.

        as 'objects'.  'output_filename' should be a filename.  If
        'output_dir' is supplied, 'output_filename' is relative to it
        (i.e. 'output_filename' can provide directory components if
        needed).

        'libraries' is a list of libraries to link against.  These are
        library names, not filenames, since they're translated into
        filenames in a platform-specific way (eg. "foo" becomes "libfoo.a"
        on Unix and "foo.lib" on DOS/Windows).  However, they can include a
        directory component, which means the linker will look in that
        specific directory rather than searching all the normal locations.

        'library_dirs', if supplied, should be a list of directories to
        search for libraries that were specified as bare library names
        (ie. no directory component).  These are on top of the system
        default and those supplied to 'add_library_dir()' and/or
        'set_library_dirs()'.  'runtime_library_dirs' is a list of
        directories that will be embedded into the shared library and used
        to search for other shared libraries that *it* depends on at
        run-time.  (This may only be relevant on Unix.)

        'export_symbols' is a list of symbols that the shared library will
        export.  (This appears to be relevant only on Windows.)

        'debug' is as for 'compile()' and 'create_static_lib()', with the
        slight distinction that it actually matters on most platforms (as
        opposed to 'create_static_lib()', which includes a 'debug' flag
        mostly for form's sake).

        'extra_preargs' and 'extra_postargs' are as for 'compile()' (except
        of course that they supply command-line arguments for the
        particular linker being used).

        'target_lang' is the target language for which the given objects
        are being compiled. This allows specific linkage time treatment of
        certain languages.

        Raises LinkError on failure.

    The basic idea behind a compiler abstraction class is that each

    single project.  Thus, attributes common to all of those compile and
    link steps -- include directories, macros to define, libraries to link

        On platforms that have the notion of a command-line (e.g. Unix,

        command-line arguments to prepend/append to the compiler command
        line.  On other platforms, consult the implementation class
        documentation.  In any event, they are intended as an escape hatch

        'library_dirs', if supplied, should be a list of directories to
        search for libraries that were specified as bare library names
        (ie. no directory component).  These are on top of the system

    charset is the input character set, and must be the canonical name of a
    character set.

    Optional header_enc and body_enc is either Charset.QP for
    quoted-printable, Charset.BASE64 for base64 encoding, Charset.SHORTEST for
    the shortest of qp or base64 encoding, or None for no encoding.  SHORTEST
    is only valid for header_enc.  It describes how message headers and
    message bodies in the input charset are to be encoded.  Default is no
    encoding.

    Optional output_charset is the character set that the output should be
    in.  Conversions will proceed from input charset, to Unicode, to the
    output charset when the method Charset.convert() is called.  The default
    is to output in the same character set as the input.

    Both input_charset and output_charset must have Unicode codec entries in
    the module's charset-to-codec mapping; use add_codec(charset, codecname)
    to add codecs the module does not know about.  See the codecs module's
    documentation for more information.
    SHORTEST not allowed for body_encAdd a character set alias.

    alias is the alias name, e.g. latin-1
    canonical is the character set's canonical name, e.g. iso-8859-1
    codecnameAdd a codec that map characters in the given charset to/from Unicode.

    charset is the canonical name of a character set.  codecname is the name
    of a Python codec, as appropriate for the second argument to the unicode()
    built-in, or to the encode() method of a Unicode string.
    _encodecodecMap character sets to their email properties.

    This class provides information about the requirements imposed on email
    for a specific character set.  It also provides convenience routines for
    converting between character sets, given the availability of the
    applicable codecs.  Given a character set, it will do its best to provide
    information on how to use that character set in an email in an
    RFC-compliant way.

    Certain character sets must be encoded with quoted-printable or base64
    when used in email headers or bodies.  Certain character sets must be
    converted outright, and are not allowed in email.  Instances of this
    module expose the following information about a character set:

    input_charset: The initial character set specified.  Common aliases
                   are converted to their `official' email names (e.g. latin_1
                   is converted to iso-8859-1).  Defaults to 7-bit us-ascii.

    header_encoding: If the character set must be encoded before it can be
                     used in an email header, this attribute will be set to
                     Charset.QP (for quoted-printable), Charset.BASE64 (for
                     base64 encoding), or Charset.SHORTEST for the shortest of
                     QP or BASE64 encoding.  Otherwise, it will be None.

    body_encoding: Same as header_encoding, but describes the encoding for the
                   mail message's body, which indeed may be different than the
                   header encoding.  Charset.SHORTEST is not allowed for
                   body_encoding.

    output_charset: Some character sets must be converted before they can be
                    used in email headers or bodies.  If the input_charset is
                    one of them, this attribute will contain the name of the
                    charset output will be converted to.  Otherwise, it will
                    be None.

    input_codec: The name of the Python codec used to convert the
                 input_charset to Unicode.  If no conversion codec is
                 necessary, this attribute will be None.

    output_codec: The name of the Python codec used to convert Unicode
                  to the output_charset.  If no conversion codec is necessary,
                  this attribute will have the same value as the input_codec.
    input_charsethencbencconvheader_encodingbody_encodinginput_codecoutput_codecget_body_encodingReturn the content-transfer-encoding used for body encoding.

        This is either the string `quoted-printable' or `base64' depending on
        the encoding used, or it is a function in which case you should call
        the function with a single argument, the Message object being
        encoded.  The function should then set the Content-Transfer-Encoding
        header itself to whatever is appropriate.

        Returns "quoted-printable" if self.body_encoding is QP.
        Returns "base64" if self.body_encoding is BASE64.
        Returns conversion function otherwise.
        quoted-printableget_output_charsetReturn the output character set.

        This is self.output_charset if that is not None, otherwise it is
        self.input_charset.
        Header-encode a string by converting it first to bytes.

        The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based on
        this charset's `header_encoding`.

        :param string: A unicode string for the header.  It must be possible
            to encode this string to bytes using the character set's
            output codec.
        :return: The encoded string, with RFC 2047 chrome.
        _get_encoderencoder_moduleheader_encode_linesmaxlengthsHeader-encode a string by converting it first to bytes.

        This is similar to `header_encode()` except that the string is fit
        into maximum line lengths as given by the argument.

        :param string: A unicode string for the header.  It must be possible
            to encode this string to bytes using the character set's
            output codec.
        :param maxlengths: Maximum line length iterator.  Each element
            returned from this iterator will provide the next maximum line
            length.  This parameter is used as an argument to built-in next()
            and should never be exhausted.  The maximum line lengths should
            not count the RFC 2047 chrome.  These line lengths are only a
            hint; the splitter does the best it can.
        :return: Lines of encoded strings, each with RFC 2047 chrome.
        current_linethis_lineseparatorjoined_linelen64lenqpBody-encode a string by converting it first to bytes.

        The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based on
        self.body_encoding.  If body_encoding is None, we assume the
        output charset is a 7bit encoding, so re-encoding the decoded
        string using the ascii codec produces the correct string version
        of the content.

                     used in an email header, this attribute will be set to
                     Charset.QP (for quoted-printable), Charset.BASE64 (for
                     base64 encoding), or Charset.SHORTEST for the shortest of
                     QP or BASE64 encoding.  Otherwise, it will be None.

                   mail message's body, which indeed may be different than the
                   header encoding.  Charset.SHORTEST is not allowed for
                   body_encoding.

    output_charset: Some character sets must be converted before they can be
                    used in email headers or bodies.  If the input_charset is
                    one of them, this attribute will contain the name of the
                    charset output will be converted to.  Otherwise, it will
                    be None.

    input_codec: The name of the Python codec used to convert the
                 input_charset to Unicode.  If no conversion codec is
                 necessary, this attribute will be None.

    output_codec: The name of the Python codec used to convert Unicode
                  to the output_charset.  If no conversion codec is necessary,
                  this attribute will have the same value as the input_codec.
    'b'Return the content-transfer-encoding used for body encoding.

        This is either the string `quoted-printable' or `base64' depending on
        the encoding used, or it is a function in which case you should call
        the function with a single argument, the Message object being
        encoded.  The function should then set the Content-Transfer-Encoding
        header itself to whatever is appropriate.

        Returns "quoted-printable" if self.body_encoding is QP.

<intro stuff goes here>

HTTPConnection goes through a number of "states", which define when a client
may legally make another request or fetch the response for a particular
request. This diagram details these state transitions:

This diagram presents the following rules:
  -- a second request may not be started until {response-headers-read}
  -- a response [object] cannot be retrieved until {request-sent}
  -- there is no differentiation between an unread response body and a
     partially read response body

Note: this enforcement is applied by the HTTPConnection class. The
      HTTPResponse class does not enforce this state machine, which
      implies sophisticated clients may accelerate the request/response
      pipeline. Caution should be taken, though: accelerating the states
      beyond the above pattern may imply knowledge of the server's
      connection-close behavior for certain requests. For example, it
      is impossible to tell whether the server will close the connection
      UNTIL the response headers have been read; this means that further
      requests cannot be placed into the pipeline until it is known that
      the server will NOT be closing the connection.

        Look through the list of headers and find all lines matching a given
        header name (and their continuation lines).  A list of the lines is
        returned, without interpretation.  If the header does not occur, an
        empty list is returned.  If the header occurs multiple times, all
        occurrences are returned.  Case is not important in the header name.

        _read_headersReads potential header lines into a list from a file pointer.

    email Parser wants to see strings rather than bytes.
    But a TextIOWrapper around self.rfile would buffer too many bytes
    from the stream, bytes which we later need to read as bytes.
    So we read the correct bytes here, as bytes, for email Parser
    to parse.

        If there are multiple matching headers, the values are
        combined into a single string separated by commas and spaces.

        If no matching header is found, returns *default* or None if

        Return list of (header, value) tuples.Returns an instance of the class mimetools.Message containing
        meta-information associated with the URL.

        When the method is HTTP, these headers are those returned by
        the server at the head of the retrieved HTML page (including
        Content-Length and Content-Type).

        When the method is FTP, a Content-Length header will be
        present if (as is now usual) the server passed back a file
        length in response to the FTP retrieval request. A
        Content-Type header will be present if the MIME type can be
        guessed.

        When the method is local-file, returned headers will include
        a Date representing the file's last-modified time, a
        Content-Length giving file size, and a Content-Type
        containing a guess at the file's type. See also the
        description of the mimetools module.

        Return the real URL of the page.

        In some cases, the HTTP server redirects a client to another
        URL. The urlopen() function handles this transparently, but in
        some cases the caller needs to know which URL the client was
        redirected to. The geturl() method can be used to get at this
        redirected URL.

        If the body is None, we set Content-Length: 0 for methods that expect
        a body (RFC 7230, Section 3.3.2). We also set the Content-Length for
        any method if the body is a str or bytes-like object and not a file.

        In a connection that uses HTTP CONNECT tunneling, the host passed to the
        constructor is used as a proxy server that relays all communication to
        the endpoint passed to `set_tunnel`. This done by sending an HTTP
        CONNECT request to the proxy server when the connection is established.

        This method must be called before the HTTP connection has been
        established.

This diagram presents the following rules:
  -- a second request may not be started until {response-headers-read}
  -- a response [object] cannot be retrieved until {request-sent}
  -- there is no differentiation between an unread response body and a
     partially read response body

Note: this enforcement is applied by the HTTPConnection class. The
      HTTPResponse class does not enforce this state machine, which
      implies sophisticated clients may accelerate the request/response
      pipeline. Caution should be taken, though: accelerating the states
      beyond the above pattern may imply knowledge of the server's
      connection-close behavior for certain requests. For example, it
      is impossible to tell whether the server will close the connection
      UNTIL the response headers have been read; this means that further
      requests cannot be placed into the pipeline until it is known that
      the server will NOT be closing the connection.

    Convert an argument tuple or a Fault instance to an XML-RPC
    request (or response, if the methodresponse option is used).

    In addition to the data object, the following options can be given
    as keyword arguments:

        methodname: the method name for a methodCall packet

        methodresponse: true to create a methodResponse packet.
        If this option is used with a tuple, the tuple must be
        a singleton (i.e. it can contain only one element).

        encoding: the packet encoding (default is UTF-8)

    All byte strings in the data structure are assumed to use the
    packet encoding.  Unicode strings are automatically converted,
    where necessary.

    The standard implementation always supports the "http" scheme.  If
    SSL socket support is available (Python 2.0), it also supports
    "https".

    If the target part and the slash preceding it are both omitted,
    "/RPC2" is assumed.

    The following options can be given as keyword arguments:

        transport: a transport factory
        encoding: the request encoding (default is UTF-8)

    All 8-bit strings passed to the server proxy are assumed to use
    the given encoding.

Interpreters constructed with this class obey the following conventions:

1. End of file on input is processed as the command 'EOF'.
2. A command is parsed out of each line by collecting the prefix composed
   of characters in the identchars member.
3. A command `foo' is dispatched to a method 'do_foo()'; the do_ method
   is passed a single argument consisting of the remainder of the line.
4. Typing an empty line repeats the last command.  (Actually, it calls the
   method `emptyline', which may be overridden in a subclass.)
5. There is a predefined `help' method.  Given an argument `topic', it
   calls the command `help_topic'.  With no arguments, it lists all topics
   with defined help_ functions, broken into up to three topics; documented
   commands, miscellaneous help topics, and undocumented commands.
6. The command '?' is a synonym for `help'.  The command '!' is a synonym
   for `shell', if a do_shell method exists.
7. If completion is enabled, completing commands will be done automatically,
   and completing of commands args is done by calling complete_foo() with
   arguments text, line, begidx, endidx.  text is string we are matching
   against, all returned matches must begin with it.  line is the current
   input line (lstripped), begidx and endidx are the beginning and end
   indexes of the text being matched, which could be used to provide
   different completion depending upon which position the argument is in.

The `default' method may be overridden to intercept commands for which there
is no do_ method.

The `completedefault' method may be overridden to intercept completions for
commands that have no complete_ method.

The data member `self.ruler' sets the character used to draw separator lines
in the help messages.  If empty, no ruler line is drawn.  It defaults to "=".

If the value of `self.intro' is nonempty when the cmdloop method is called,
it is printed out on interpreter startup.  This value may be overridden
via an optional argument to the cmdloop() method.

The data members `self.doc_header', `self.misc_header', and
`self.undoc_header' set the headers used for the help function's
listings of documented functions, miscellaneous topics, and undocumented
functions respectively.
Cmd(Cmd) PROMPTIDENTCHARSA simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters.

    These are often useful for test harnesses, administrative tools, and
    prototypes that will later be wrapped in a more sophisticated interface.

    A Cmd instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter
    framework.  There is no good reason to instantiate Cmd itself; rather,
    it's useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself
    in order to inherit Cmd's methods and encapsulate action methods.

        The optional argument 'completekey' is the readline name of a

        is done automatically. The optional arguments stdin and stdout

        parselineParse the line into a command name and a string containing
        the arguments.  Returns a tuple containing (command, args, line).
        'command' and 'args' may be None if the line couldn't be parsed.
        help do_shellshell Interpret the argument as though it had been typed in response
        to the prompt.

        This may be overridden, but should not normally need to be;
        see the precmd() and postcmd() methods for useful execution hooks.
        The return value is a flag indicating whether interpretation of
        commands by the interpreter should stop.

codeopCommandCompilercompile_commandInteractiveInterpreterInteractiveConsoleinteractBase class for InteractiveConsole.

    This class deals with parsing and interpreter state (the user's
    namespace); it doesn't deal with input buffering or prompting or
    input file naming (the filename is always passed in explicitly).

    Constructor.

        The optional 'locals' argument specifies the dictionary in
        which code will be executed; it defaults to a newly created
        dictionary with key "__name__" set to "__console__" and key
        "__doc__" set to None.

        __console__runsource<input>singlesymbolCompile and run some source in the interpreter.

        Arguments are as for compile_command().

        One of several things can happen:

        1) The input is incorrect; compile_command() raised an
        exception (SyntaxError or OverflowError).  A syntax traceback
        will be printed by calling the showsyntaxerror() method.

        2) The input is incomplete, and more input is required;
        compile_command() returned None.  Nothing happens.

        3) The input is complete; compile_command() returned a code
        object.  The code is executed by calling self.runcode() (which
        also handles run-time exceptions, except for SystemExit).

        The return value is True in case 2, False in the other cases (unless
        an exception is raised).  The return value can be used to
        decide whether to use sys.ps1 or sys.ps2 to prompt the next
        line.

        showsyntaxerrorruncodeExecute a code object.

        When an exception occurs, self.showtraceback() is called to
        display a traceback.  All exceptions are caught except
        SystemExit, which is reraised.

        A note about KeyboardInterrupt: this exception may occur
        elsewhere in this code, and may not always be caught.  The
        caller should be prepared to deal with it.

        showtracebackDisplay the syntax error that just occurred.

        This doesn't display a stack trace because there isn't one.

        If a filename is given, it is stuffed in the exception instead
        of what was there before (because Python's parser always uses
        "<string>" when reading from a string).

        The output is written by self.write(), below.

        last_typelast_valuelast_tracebackdummy_filenameDisplay the exception that just occurred.

        We remove the first stack item because it is our own code.

        The output is written by self.write(), below.

        last_tbformat_exceptionWrite a string.

        The base implementation writes to sys.stderr; a subclass may
        replace this with a different implementation.

        Closely emulate the behavior of the interactive Python interpreter.

    This class builds on InteractiveInterpreter and adds prompting
    using the familiar sys.ps1 and sys.ps2, and input buffering.

    <console>Constructor.

        The optional locals argument will be passed to the
        InteractiveInterpreter base class.

        The optional filename argument should specify the (file)name
        of the input stream; it will show up in tracebacks.

        resetbufferReset the input buffer.bannerexitmsgClosely emulate the interactive Python console.

        The optional banner argument specifies the banner to print
        before the first interaction; by default it prints a banner
        similar to the one printed by the real Python interpreter,
        followed by the current class name in parentheses (so as not
        to confuse this with the real interpreter -- since it's so
        close!).

        The optional exitmsg argument specifies the exit message
        printed when exiting. Pass the empty string to suppress
        printing an exit message. If exitmsg is not given or None,
        a default message is printed.

Push a line to the interpreter.

        The line should not have a trailing newline; it may have
        internal newlines.  The line is appended to a buffer and the
        interpreter's runsource() method is called with the
        concatenated contents of the buffer as source.  If this
        indicates that the command was executed or invalid, the buffer
        is reset; otherwise, the command is incomplete, and the buffer
        is left as it was after the line was appended.  The return
        value is 1 if more input is required, 0 if the line was dealt
        with in some way (this is the same as runsource()).

        Write a prompt and read a line.

        The returned line does not include the trailing newline.
        When the user enters the EOF key sequence, EOFError is raised.

        The base implementation uses the built-in function
        input(); a subclass may replace this with a different
        implementation.

        readfuncClosely emulate the interactive Python interpreter.

    This is a backwards compatible interface to the InteractiveConsole
    class.  When readfunc is not specified, it attempts to import the
    readline module to enable GNU readline if it is available.

    Arguments (all optional, all default to None):

    banner -- passed to InteractiveConsole.interact()
    readfunc -- if not None, replaces InteractiveConsole.raw_input()
    local -- passed to InteractiveInterpreter.__init__()
    exitmsg -- passed to InteractiveConsole.interact()

        The .encode()/.decode() methods may use different error

         'replace' - replace with a suitable replacement character;

            The decoder must be able to handle zero length input and
            return an empty object of the output object type in this
            situation.

        
    An IncrementalEncoder encodes an input in multiple steps. The input can
    be passed piece by piece to the encode() method. The IncrementalEncoder
    remembers the state of the encoding process between calls to encode().
    
        Creates an IncrementalEncoder instance.

        The IncrementalEncoder may use different error handling schemes by
        providing the errors keyword argument. See the module docstring
        for a list of possible values.
        
        Encodes input and returns the resulting object.
        
        Resets the encoder to the initial state.
        
        Return the current state of the encoder.
        
        Set the current state of the encoder. state must have been
        returned by getstate().
        BufferedIncrementalEncoder
    This subclass of IncrementalEncoder can be used as the baseclass for an
    incremental encoder if the encoder must keep some of the output in a
    buffer between calls to encode().
    _buffer_encodeconsumed
    An IncrementalDecoder decodes an input in multiple steps. The input can
    be passed piece by piece to the decode() method. The IncrementalDecoder
    remembers the state of the decoding process between calls to decode().
    
        Create an IncrementalDecoder instance.

        The IncrementalDecoder may use different error handling schemes by
        providing the errors keyword argument. See the module docstring
        for a list of possible values.
        
        Decode input and returns the resulting object.
        
        Reset the decoder to the initial state.
        
        Return the current state of the decoder.

        This must be a (buffered_input, additional_state_info) tuple.
        buffered_input must be a bytes object containing bytes that
        were passed to decode() that have not yet been converted.
        additional_state_info must be a non-negative integer
        representing the state of the decoder WITHOUT yet having
        processed the contents of buffered_input.  In the initial state
        and after reset(), getstate() must return (b"", 0).
        
        Set the current state of the decoder.

        state must have been returned by getstate().  The effect of
        setstate((b"", 0)) must be equivalent to reset().
        BufferedIncrementalDecoder
    This subclass of IncrementalDecoder can be used as the baseclass for an
    incremental decoder if the decoder must be able to handle incomplete
    byte sequences.
    _buffer_decode Creates a StreamWriter instance.

            stream must be a file-like object open for writing.

            The StreamWriter may use different error handling
            schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. These
            parameters are predefined:

             'strict' - raise a ValueError (or a subclass)
             'ignore' - ignore the character and continue with the next
             'replace'- replace with a suitable replacement character
             'xmlcharrefreplace' - Replace with the appropriate XML
                                   character reference.
             'backslashreplace'  - Replace with backslashed escape
                                   sequences.
             'namereplace'       - Replace with \N{...} escape sequences.

            The set of allowed parameter values can be extended via
            register_error.
         Writes the object's contents encoded to self.stream.
         Writes the concatenated list of strings to the stream
            using .write().
         Flushes and resets the codec buffers used for keeping state.

            Calling this method should ensure that the data on the
            output is put into a clean state, that allows appending
            of new fresh data without having to rescan the whole
            stream to recover state.

         Inherit all other methods from the underlying stream.
        charbuffertype Creates a StreamReader instance.

            stream must be a file-like object open for reading.

            The StreamReader may use different error handling
            schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. These
            parameters are predefined:

             'strict' - raise a ValueError (or a subclass)
             'ignore' - ignore the character and continue with the next
             'replace'- replace with a suitable replacement character
             'backslashreplace' - Replace with backslashed escape sequences;

            The set of allowed parameter values can be extended via
            register_error.
        bytebuffer_empty_charbuffercharbufferlinebufferfirstline Decodes data from the stream self.stream and returns the
            resulting object.

            chars indicates the number of decoded code points or bytes to
            return. read() will never return more data than requested,
            but it might return less, if there is not enough available.

            size indicates the approximate maximum number of decoded
            bytes or code points to read for decoding. The decoder
            can modify this setting as appropriate. The default value
            -1 indicates to read and decode as much as possible.  size
            is intended to prevent having to decode huge files in one
            step.

            If firstline is true, and a UnicodeDecodeError happens
            after the first line terminator in the input only the first line
            will be returned, the rest of the input will be kept until the
            next call to read().

            The method should use a greedy read strategy, meaning that
            it should read as much data as is allowed within the
            definition of the encoding and the given size, e.g.  if
            optional encoding endings or state markers are available
            on the stream, these should be read too.
        newdatanewcharsdecodedbytes Read one line from the input stream and return the
            decoded data.

            size, if given, is passed as size argument to the
            read() method.

        72readsizeline0withendline0withoutend8000sizehint Read all lines available on the input stream
            and return them as a list.

            Line breaks are implemented using the codec's decoder
            method and are included in the list entries.

            sizehint, if given, is ignored since there is no efficient
            way to finding the true end-of-line.

         Resets the codec buffers used for keeping state.

            Note that no stream repositioning should take place.
            This method is primarily intended to be able to recover
            from decoding errors.

         Set the input stream's current position.

            Resets the codec buffers used for keeping state.
         Return the next decoded line from the input stream. StreamReaderWriter instances allow wrapping streams which
        work in both read and write modes.

        The design is such that one can use the factory functions
        returned by the codec.lookup() function to construct the
        instance.

    unknownReaderWriter Creates a StreamReaderWriter instance.

            stream must be a Stream-like object.

            Reader, Writer must be factory functions or classes
            providing the StreamReader, StreamWriter interface resp.

            Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the
            StreamWriter/Readers.

        readerwriter StreamRecoder instances translate data from one encoding to another.

        They use the complete set of APIs returned by the
        codecs.lookup() function to implement their task.

        Data written to the StreamRecoder is first decoded into an
        intermediate format (depending on the "decode" codec) and then
        written to the underlying stream using an instance of the provided
        Writer class.

        In the other direction, data is read from the underlying stream using
        a Reader instance and then encoded and returned to the caller.

    data_encodingfile_encoding Creates a StreamRecoder instance which implements a two-way
            conversion: encode and decode work on the frontend (the
            data visible to .read() and .write()) while Reader and Writer
            work on the backend (the data in stream).

            You can use these objects to do transparent
            transcodings from e.g. latin-1 to utf-8 and back.

            stream must be a file-like object.

            encode and decode must adhere to the Codec interface; Reader and
            Writer must be factory functions or classes providing the
            StreamReader and StreamWriter interfaces resp.

            Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the
            StreamWriter/Readers.

        bytesencodedbytesdecoded Open an encoded file using the given mode and return
        a wrapped version providing transparent encoding/decoding.

        Note: The wrapped version will only accept the object format
        defined by the codecs, i.e. Unicode objects for most builtin
        codecs. Output is also codec dependent and will usually be
        Unicode as well.

        Underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode.
        The default file mode is 'r', meaning to open the file in read mode.

        encoding specifies the encoding which is to be used for the
        file.

        errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults
        to 'strict' which causes ValueErrors to be raised in case an
        encoding error occurs.

        buffering has the same meaning as for the builtin open() API.
        It defaults to -1 which means that the default buffer size will
        be used.

        The returned wrapped file object provides an extra attribute
        .encoding which allows querying the used encoding. This
        attribute is only available if an encoding was specified as
        parameter.

    srw Return a wrapped version of file which provides transparent
        encoding translation.

        Data written to the wrapped file is decoded according
        to the given data_encoding and then encoded to the underlying
        file using file_encoding. The intermediate data type
        will usually be Unicode but depends on the specified codecs.

        Bytes read from the file are decoded using file_encoding and then
        passed back to the caller encoded using data_encoding.

        If file_encoding is not given, it defaults to data_encoding.

        errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults
        to 'strict' which causes ValueErrors to be raised in case an
        encoding error occurs.

        The returned wrapped file object provides two extra attributes
        .data_encoding and .file_encoding which reflect the given
        parameters of the same name. The attributes can be used for
        introspection by Python programs.

    data_infofile_infosr Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its encoder function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its decoder function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its IncrementalEncoder class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found
        or the codecs doesn't provide an incremental encoder.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its IncrementalDecoder class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found
        or the codecs doesn't provide an incremental decoder.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its StreamReader class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its StreamWriter class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

    
    Encoding iterator.

    Encodes the input strings from the iterator using an IncrementalEncoder.

    errors and kwargs are passed through to the IncrementalEncoder
    constructor.
    
    Decoding iterator.

    Decodes the input strings from the iterator using an IncrementalDecoder.

    errors and kwargs are passed through to the IncrementalDecoder
    constructor.
    make_identity_dictrng make_identity_dict(rng) -> dict

        Return a dictionary where elements of the rng sequence are
        mapped to themselves.

    make_encoding_mapdecoding_map Creates an encoding map from a decoding map.

        If a target mapping in the decoding map occurs multiple
        times, then that target is mapped to None (undefined mapping),
        causing an exception when encountered by the charmap codec
        during translation.

        One example where this happens is cp875.py which decodes
        multiple character to \u001a.

            size indicates the approximate maximum number of decoded
            bytes or code points to read for decoding. The decoder

            is intended to prevent having to decode huge files in one
            step.

            If firstline is true, and a UnicodeDecodeError happens

            will be returned, the rest of the input will be kept until the

        'b' StreamRecoder instances translate data from one encoding to another.

        They use the complete set of APIs returned by the
        codecs.lookup() function to implement their task.

        Data written to the StreamRecoder is first decoded into an
        intermediate format (depending on the "decode" codec) and then
        written to the underlying stream using an instance of the provided
        Writer class.

        In the other direction, data is read from the underlying stream using
        a Reader instance and then encoded and returned to the caller.

        codecs. Output is also codec dependent and will usually be
        Unicode as well.

        Underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode.
        The default file mode is 'r', meaning to open the file in read mode.

    'b' make_identity_dict(rng) -> dict

        Return a dictionary where elements of the rng sequence are
        mapped to themselves.

    'u' make_identity_dict(rng) -> dict

        Return a dictionary where elements of the rng sequence are
        mapped to themselves.

    'b' Creates an encoding map from a decoding map.

        If a target mapping in the decoding map occurs multiple
        times, then that target is mapped to None (undefined mapping),
        causing an exception when encountered by the charmap codec
        during translation.

        One example where this happens is cp875.py which decodes
        multiple character to \u001a.

    'b'backslashreplace'u'backslashreplace'b'namereplace'u'namereplace'u'codecs'Utilities to compile possibly incomplete Python source code.

This module provides two interfaces, broadly similar to the builtin
function compile(), which take program text, a filename and a 'mode'
and:

- Return code object if the command is complete and valid
- Return None if the command is incomplete
- Raise SyntaxError, ValueError or OverflowError if the command is a
  syntax error (OverflowError and ValueError can be produced by
  malformed literals).

Approach:

First, check if the source consists entirely of blank lines and
comments; if so, replace it with 'pass', because the built-in
parser doesn't always do the right thing for these.

Compile three times: as is, with \n, and with \n\n appended.  If it
compiles as is, it's complete.  If it compiles with one \n appended,
we expect more.  If it doesn't compile either way, we compare the
error we get when compiling with \n or \n\n appended.  If the errors
are the same, the code is broken.  But if the errors are different, we
expect more.  Not intuitive; not even guaranteed to hold in future
releases; but this matches the compiler's behavior from Python 1.4
through 2.2, at least.

Caveat:

It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a
successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this
case, trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error.
For example, a backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by
arbitrary garbage.  This will be fixed once the API for the parser is
better.

The two interfaces are:

    the instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts
    with the statement in force.

    Based on :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection` but provides an extra constructor
    backwards-compatibility layer between older and newer Pythons.

    Additional keyword parameters are used to configure attributes of the connection.
    Accepted parameters include:

    - ``strict``: See the documentation on :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool`
    - ``source_address``: Set the source address for the current connection.
    - ``socket_options``: Set specific options on the underlying socket. If not specified, then
      defaults are loaded from ``HTTPConnection.default_socket_options`` which includes disabling
      Nagle's algorithm (sets TCP_NODELAY to 1) unless the connection is behind a proxy.

      For example, if you wish to enable TCP Keep Alive in addition to the defaults,
      you might pass:

      .. code-block:: python

         HTTPConnection.default_socket_options + [
             (socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_KEEPALIVE, 1),

    default_socket_optionsis_verifiedproxy_is_verifiedsocket_optionsproxy_config
        Getter method to remove any trailing dots that indicate the hostname is an FQDN.

        In general, SSL certificates don't include the trailing dot indicating a
        fully-qualified domain name, and thus, they don't validate properly when
        checked against a domain name that includes the dot. In addition, some
        servers may not expect to receive the trailing dot when provided.

        However, the hostname with trailing dot is critical to DNS resolution; doing a
        lookup with the trailing dot will properly only resolve the appropriate FQDN,
        whereas a lookup without a trailing dot will search the system's search domain
        list. Thus, it's important to keep the original host around for use only in
        those cases where it's appropriate (i.e., when doing DNS lookup to establish the
        actual TCP connection across which we're going to send HTTP requests).

        If no connections are available and :prop:`.block` is ``False``, then a
        fresh connection is returned.

        :param timeout:
            Seconds to wait before giving up and raising
            :class:`urllib3.exceptions.EmptyPoolError` if the pool is empty and

            Connection object for the current host and port as returned by
            :meth:`._new_conn` or :meth:`._get_conn`.

        If the pool is already full, the connection is closed and discarded
        because we exceeded maxsize. If connections are discarded frequently,
        then maxsize should be increased.

            the socket connect and the socket read, or an instance of

        pool_timeoutrelease_connbody_posresponse_kw
        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.

        .. note::

           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method provided
           by :class:`.RequestMethods`, such as :meth:`request`.

        .. note::

           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.

        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.

        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.

        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.

        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.

            Pass ``None`` to retry until you receive a response. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.

            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.

        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.

        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.

        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.

        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.

        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of
            ``response_kw.get('preload_content', True)``.

        :param chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.

        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        :param \**response_kw:
            Additional parameters are passed to
            :meth:`urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.from_httplib`

    Same as :class:`.HTTPConnectionPool`, but HTTPS.

    :class:`.HTTPSConnection` uses one of ``assert_fingerprint``,
    ``assert_hostname`` and ``host`` in this order to verify connections.
    If ``assert_hostname`` is False, no verification is done.

    The ``key_file``, ``cert_file``, ``cert_reqs``, ``ca_certs``,
    ``ca_cert_dir``, ``ssl_version``, ``key_password`` are only used if :mod:`ssl`
    is available and are fed into :meth:`urllib3.util.ssl_wrap_socket` to upgrade
    the connection socket into an SSL socket.
    
        Prepare the ``connection`` for :meth:`urllib3.util.ssl_wrap_socket`
        and establish the tunnel if proxy is used.
        
        Establishes a tunnel connection through HTTP CONNECT.

        Tunnel connection is established early because otherwise httplib would
        improperly set Host: header to proxy's IP:port.

    Given a url, return an :class:`.ConnectionPool` instance of its host.

    This is a shortcut for not having to parse out the scheme, host, and port
    of the url before creating an :class:`.ConnectionPool` instance.

    :param url:
        Absolute URL string that must include the scheme. Port is optional.

    :param \**kw:
        Passes additional parameters to the constructor of the appropriate
        :class:`.ConnectionPool`. Useful for specifying things like
        timeout, maxsize, headers, etc.

    Example::

        >>> conn = connection_from_url('http://google.com/')
        >>> r = conn.request('GET', '/')
    
    Normalize hosts for comparisons and use with sockets.

        or an instance of :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout` which gives you more
        fine-grained control over request timeouts. After the constructor has
        been parsed, this is always a `urllib3.util.Timeout` object.

    :param maxsize:
        Number of connections to save that can be reused. More than 1 is useful

        been used.

    :param block:
        If set to True, no more than ``maxsize`` connections will be used at
        a time. When no free connections are available, the call will block
        until a connection has been released. This is a useful side effect for
        particular multithreaded situations where one does not want to use more
        than maxsize connections per host to prevent flooding.

        :param conn:
            a connection from one of our connection pools

        :param timeout:
            Socket timeout in seconds for the request. This can be a
            float or integer, which will set the same timeout value for
            the socket connect and the socket read, or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`, which gives you more fine-grained
            control over your timeouts.

        Check if the given ``url`` is a member of the same host as this
        connection pool.

        Check if the given ``url`` is a member of the same host as this
        connection pool.
        'b'
        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.

        .. note::

           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method provided
           by :class:`.RequestMethods`, such as :meth:`request`.

        .. note::

           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.

        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.

        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.

        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.

        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.

            Pass ``None`` to retry until you receive a response. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.

            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.

        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.

        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.

        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.

        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.

        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of
            ``response_kw.get('preload_content', True)``.

        :param chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.

        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        :param \**response_kw:
            Additional parameters are passed to
            :meth:`urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.from_httplib`
        'u'
        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.

    Same as :class:`.HTTPConnectionPool`, but HTTPS.

    :class:`.HTTPSConnection` uses one of ``assert_fingerprint``,
    ``assert_hostname`` and ``host`` in this order to verify connections.

    The ``key_file``, ``cert_file``, ``cert_reqs``, ``ca_certs``,
    ``ca_cert_dir``, ``ssl_version``, ``key_password`` are only used if :mod:`ssl`

This module has (now fairly distant) origins in Gisle Aas' Perl module
HTTP::Cookies, from the libwww-perl library.

Docstrings, comments and debug strings in this code refer to the
attributes of the HTTP cookie system as cookie-attributes, to distinguish
them clearly from Python attributes.

    Return value is an integer.

    None is returned if the format of str is unrecognized, the time is outside
    the representable range, or the timezone string is not recognized.  If the
    string contains no timezone, UTC is assumed.

    The timezone in the string may be numerical (like "-0800" or "+0100") or a
    string timezone (like "UTC", "GMT", "BST" or "EST").  Currently, only the
    timezone strings equivalent to UTC (zero offset) are known to the function.

    The function loosely parses the following formats:

    Wed, 09 Feb 1994 22:23:32 GMT       -- HTTP format
    Tuesday, 08-Feb-94 14:15:29 GMT     -- old rfc850 HTTP format

    08-Feb-1994 14:15:29 GMT            -- broken rfc850 format (no weekday)

    The parser ignores leading and trailing whitespace.  The time may be
    absent.

    If the year is given with only 2 digits, the function will select the
    century that makes the year closest to the current date.

    The function knows how to deal with ",", ";" and "=" as well as quoted
    values after "=".  A list of space separated tokens are parsed as if they
    were separated by ";".

    If the header_values passed as argument contains multiple values, then they
    are treated as if they were a single value separated by comma ",".

    This means that this function is useful for parsing header fields that
    follow this syntax (BNF as from the HTTP/1.1 specification, but we relax
    the requirement for tokens).

      headers           = #header
      header            = (token | parameter) *( [";"] (token | parameter))

      token             = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>
      separators        = "(" | ")" | "<" | ">" | "@"
                        | "," | ";" | ":" | "\" | <">
                        | "/" | "[" | "]" | "?" | "="

      parameter         = attribute "=" value
      attribute         = token
      value             = token | quoted-string

    Each header is represented by a list of key/value pairs.  The value for a
    simple token (not part of a parameter) is None.  Syntactically incorrect
    headers will not necessarily be parsed as you would want.

    This is easier to describe with some examples:

    >>> split_header_words(['foo="bar"; port="80,81"; discard, bar=baz'])
    [[('foo', 'bar'), ('port', '80,81'), ('discard', None)], [('bar', 'baz')]]
    >>> split_header_words(['text/html; charset="iso-8859-1"'])
    [[('text/html', None), ('charset', 'iso-8859-1')]]
    >>> split_header_words([r'Basic realm="\"foo\bar\""'])

    Takes a list of lists of (key, value) pairs and produces a single header
    value.  Attribute values are quoted if needed.

    >>> join_header_words([[("text/plain", None), ("charset", "iso-8859-1")]])
    'text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"'

    The old Netscape cookie format for Set-Cookie can for instance contain
    an unquoted "," in the expires field, so we have to use this ad-hoc
    parser instead of split_header_words.

    XXX This may not make the best possible effort to parse all the crap
    that Netscape Cookie headers contain.  Ronald Tschalar's HTTPClient
    parser is probably better, so could do worse than following that if
    this ever gives any trouble.

    Currently, this is also used for parsing RFC 2109 cookies.

    A and B may be host domain names or IP addresses.

    RFC 2965, section 1:

    Host names can be specified either as an IP address or a HDN string.
    Sometimes we compare one host name with another.  (Such comparisons SHALL
    be case-insensitive.)  Host A's name domain-matches host B's if

         *  their host name strings string-compare equal; or

         * A is a HDN string and has the form NB, where N is a non-empty
            name string, B has the form .B', and B' is a HDN string.  (So,
            x.y.com domain-matches .Y.com but not Y.com.)

    Note that domain-match is not a commutative operation: a.b.c.com
    domain-matches .c.com, but not the reverse.

          -  H has the form A.B; and

          -  A has no embedded (that is, interior) dots; and

          -  B has at least one embedded dot, or B is the string "local".
             then the reach of H is .B.

       *  Otherwise, the reach of H is H.

    This class represents both Netscape and RFC 2965 cookies.

    This is deliberately a very simple class.  It just holds attributes.  It's
    possible to construct Cookie instances that don't comply with the cookie
    standards.  CookieJar.make_cookies is the factory function for Cookie
    objects -- it deals with cookie parsing, supplying defaults, and
    normalising to the representation used in this class.  CookiePolicy is
    responsible for checking them to see whether they should be accepted from
    and returned to the server.

    Note that the port may be present in the headers, but unspecified ("Port"
    rather than"Port=80", for example); if this is the case, port is None.

        You probably don't need to call this method: expired cookies are never
        sent back to the server (provided you're using DefaultCookiePolicy),
        this method is called by CookieJar itself every so often, and the
        .save() method won't save expired cookies anyway (unless you ask
        otherwise by passing a true ignore_expires argument).

        Return number of contained cookies.<%s[%s]>CookieJar that can be loaded from and saved to a file.delayload
        Cookies are NOT loaded from the named file until either the .load() or
        .revert() method is called.

        ignore_discardignore_expiresSave cookies to a file.Load cookies from a file._really_loadrevertClear all cookies and reload cookies from a saved file.

        Raises LoadError (or OSError) if reversion is not successful; the
        object's state will not be altered if this happens.

        deepcopyold_statelwp_cookie_strReturn string representation of Cookie in the LWP cookie file format.

    Actually, the format is extended a bit -- see module docstring.

    path_specport_specdomain_dot
    The LWPCookieJar saves a sequence of "Set-Cookie3" lines.
    "Set-Cookie3" is the format used by the libwww-perl library, not known
    to be compatible with any browser, but which is easy to read and
    doesn't lose information about RFC 2965 cookies.

    Additional methods

    as_lwp_str(ignore_discard=True, ignore_expired=True)

    as_lwp_strReturn cookies as a string of "\n"-separated "Set-Cookie3" headers.

    WARNING: you may want to backup your browser's cookies file if you use
    this class to save cookies.  I *think* it works, but there have been
    bugs in the past!

    This class differs from CookieJar only in the format it uses to save and
    load cookies to and from a file.  This class uses the Mozilla/Netscape
    `cookies.txt' format.  lynx uses this file format, too.

    Don't expect cookies saved while the browser is running to be noticed by
    the browser (in fact, Mozilla on unix will overwrite your saved cookies if
    you change them on disk while it's running; on Windows, you probably can't
    save at all while the browser is running).

    Note that the Mozilla/Netscape format will downgrade RFC2965 cookies to
    Netscape cookies on saving.

    In particular, the cookie version and port number information is lost,
    together with information about whether or not Path, Port and Discard were
    specified by the Set-Cookie2 (or Set-Cookie) header, and whether or not the
    domain as set in the HTTP header started with a dot (yes, I'm aware some
    domains in Netscape files start with a dot and some don't -- trust me, you
    really don't want to know any more about this).

    Note that though Mozilla and Netscape use the same format, they use
    slightly different headers.  The class saves cookies using the Netscape
    header by default (Mozilla can cope with that).

        this method is called by CookieJar itself every so often, and the
        .save() method won't save expired cookies anyway (unless you ask
        otherwise by passing a true ignore_expires argument).

    WARNING: you may want to backup your browser's cookies file if you use
    this class to save cookies.  I *think* it works, but there have been
    bugs in the past!

    This class differs from CookieJar only in the format it uses to save and
    load cookies to and from a file.  This class uses the Mozilla/Netscape
    `cookies.txt' format.  lynx uses this file format, too.

    Don't expect cookies saved while the browser is running to be noticed by
    the browser (in fact, Mozilla on unix will overwrite your saved cookies if
    you change them on disk while it's running; on Windows, you probably can't
    save at all while the browser is running).

    Note that the Mozilla/Netscape format will downgrade RFC2965 cookies to
    Netscape cookies on saving.

    In particular, the cookie version and port number information is lost,
    together with information about whether or not Path, Port and Discard were
    specified by the Set-Cookie2 (or Set-Cookie) header, and whether or not the
    domain as set in the HTTP header started with a dot (yes, I'm aware some
    domains in Netscape files start with a dot and some don't -- trust me, you
    really don't want to know any more about this).

    Note that though Mozilla and Netscape use the same format, they use
    slightly different headers.  The class saves cookies using the Netscape
    header by default (Mozilla can cope with that).

Here's a sample session to show how to use this module.
At the moment, this is the only documentation.

The Basics
----------

Importing is easy...

   >>> from http import cookies

Most of the time you start by creating a cookie.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()

Once you've created your Cookie, you can add values just as if it were
a dictionary.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["fig"] = "newton"
   >>> C["sugar"] = "wafer"
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: fig=newton\r\nSet-Cookie: sugar=wafer'

Notice that the printable representation of a Cookie is the
appropriate format for a Set-Cookie: header.  This is the
default behavior.  You can change the header and printed
attributes by using the .output() function

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["rocky"] = "road"
   >>> C["rocky"]["path"] = "/cookie"
   >>> print(C.output(header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road; Path=/cookie
   >>> print(C.output(attrs=[], header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road

The load() method of a Cookie extracts cookies from a string.  In a
CGI script, you would use this method to extract the cookies from the
HTTP_COOKIE environment variable.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load("chips=ahoy; vienna=finger")
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: chips=ahoy\r\nSet-Cookie: vienna=finger'

The load() method is darn-tootin smart about identifying cookies
within a string.  Escaped quotation marks, nested semicolons, and other
such trickeries do not confuse it.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load('keebler="E=everybody; L=\\"Loves\\"; fudge=\\012;";')
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: keebler="E=everybody; L=\"Loves\"; fudge=\012;"

Each element of the Cookie also supports all of the RFC 2109
Cookie attributes.  Here's an example which sets the Path
attribute.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["oreo"] = "doublestuff"
   >>> C["oreo"]["path"] = "/"
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: oreo=doublestuff; Path=/

Each dictionary element has a 'value' attribute, which gives you
back the value associated with the key.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["twix"] = "none for you"
   >>> C["twix"].value
   'none for you'

The SimpleCookie expects that all values should be standard strings.
Just to be sure, SimpleCookie invokes the str() builtin to convert
the value to a string, when the values are set dictionary-style.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["number"] = 7
   >>> C["string"] = "seven"
   >>> C["number"].value
   '7'
   >>> C["string"].value
   'seven'
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: number=7\r\nSet-Cookie: string=seven'

Notice that the printable representation of a Cookie is the

attributes by using the .output() function

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["rocky"] = "road"
   >>> C["rocky"]["path"] = "/cookie"
   >>> print(C.output(header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road; Path=/cookie

The load() method is darn-tootin smart about identifying cookies
within a string.  Escaped quotation marks, nested semicolons, and other
such trickeries do not confuse it.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load('keebler="E=everybody; L=\\"Loves\\"; fudge=\\012;";')
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: keebler="E=everybody; L=\"Loves\"; fudge=\012;"

Each element of the Cookie also supports all of the RFC 2109
Cookie attributes.  Here's an example which sets the Path
attribute.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["oreo"] = "doublestuff"
   >>> C["oreo"]["path"] = "/"
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: oreo=doublestuff; Path=/

Each dictionary element has a 'value' attribute, which gives you
back the value associated with the key.

Compatibility code to be able to use `cookielib.CookieJar` with requests.

requests.utils imports from here, so be careful with imports.
dummy_threadingMockRequestWraps a `requests.Request` to mimic a `urllib2.Request`.

    The code in `cookielib.CookieJar` expects this interface in order to correctly
    manage cookie policies, i.e., determine whether a cookie can be set, given the
    domains of the request and the cookie.

    The original request object is read-only. The client is responsible for collecting
    the new headers via `get_new_headers()` and interpreting them appropriately. You
    probably want `get_cookie_header`, defined below.
    _new_headersget_typeget_origin_req_hostis_unverifiablecookielib has no legitimate use for this method; add it back if you find one.Cookie headers should be added with add_unredirected_header()get_new_headersMockResponseWraps a `httplib.HTTPMessage` to mimic a `urllib.addinfourl`.

    interface.

    This is the CookieJar we create by default for requests and sessions that
    don't specify one, since some clients may expect response.cookies and
    session.cookies to support dict operations.

    Requests does not use the dict interface internally; it's just for
    compatibility with external client code. All requests code should work
    out of the box with externally provided instances of ``CookieJar``, e.g.
    ``LWPCookieJar`` and ``FileCookieJar``.

    Unlike a regular CookieJar, this class is pickleable.

Interface summary:

        import copy

        x = copy.copy(y)        # make a shallow copy of y
        x = copy.deepcopy(y)    # make a deep copy of y

For module specific errors, copy.Error is raised.

The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for
compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or
class instances).

- A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the
  extent possible) inserts *the same objects* into it that the
  original contains.

- A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively,
  inserts *copies* into it of the objects found in the original.

Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don't exist
with shallow copy operations:

 a) recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly,
    contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop

 b) because deep copy copies *everything* it may copy too much, e.g.
    administrative data structures that should be shared even between
    copies

Python's deep copy operation avoids these problems by:

 a) keeping a table of objects already copied during the current
    copying pass

 b) letting user-defined classes override the copying operation or the
    set of components copied

This version does not copy types like module, class, function, method,
nor stack trace, stack frame, nor file, socket, window, nor array, nor
any similar types.

Classes can use the same interfaces to control copying that they use
to control pickling: they can define methods called __getinitargs__(),
__getstate__() and __setstate__().  See the documentation for module
"pickle" for information on these methods.

    When the ratio is exactly half-way between two integers,
    the even integer is returned.
    greater_than_halfRepresent the difference between two datetime objects.

    Supported operators:

    - add, subtract timedelta
    - unary plus, minus, abs
    - compare to timedelta
    - multiply, divide by int

    In addition, datetime supports subtraction of two datetime objects
    returning a timedelta, and addition or subtraction of a datetime
    and a timedelta giving a datetime.

    Representation: (days, seconds, microseconds).  Why?  Because I

Then it wants to add a duration k to y, so that [1]# becomes true; in effect, we want to solve [2] for k:#    (y+k).n - (y+k).o = x.n                      [2]# By #1, this is the same as#    (y+k).n - ((y+k).s + (y+k).d) = x.n          [3]# By #5, (y+k).n = y.n + k, which equals x.n + k because x.n=y.n at the start.# Substituting that into [3],#    x.n + k - (y+k).s - (y+k).d = x.n; the x.n terms cancel, leaving#    k - (y+k).s - (y+k).d = 0; rearranging,#    k = (y+k).s - (y+k).d; by #4, (y+k).s == y.s, so#    k = y.s - (y+k).d# On the RHS, (y+k).d can't be computed directly, but y.s can be, and we# approximate k by ignoring the (y+k).d term at first.  Note that k can't be# very large, since all offset-returning methods return a duration of magnitude# less than 24 hours.  For that reason, if y is firmly in std time, (y+k).d must# be 0, so ignoring it has no consequence then.# In any case, the new value is#     z = y + y.s                                 [4]# It's helpful to step back at look at [4] from a higher level:  it's simply# mapping from UTC to tz's standard time.# At this point, if#     z.n - z.o = x.n                             [5]# we have an equivalent time, and are almost done.  The insecurity here is# at the start of daylight time.  Picture US Eastern for concreteness.  The wall# time jumps from 1:59 to 3:00, and wall hours of the form 2:MM don't make good# sense then.  The docs ask that an Eastern tzinfo class consider such a time to# be EDT (because it's "after 2"), which is a redundant spelling of 1:MM EST# on the day DST starts.  We want to return the 1:MM EST spelling because that's# the only spelling that makes sense on the local wall clock.# In fact, if [5] holds at this point, we do have the standard-time spelling,# but that takes a bit of proof.  We first prove a stronger result.  What's the# difference between the LHS and RHS of [5]?  Let#     diff = x.n - (z.n - z.o)                    [6]# Now#     z.n =                       by [4]#     (y + y.s).n =               by #5#     y.n + y.s =                 since y.n = x.n#     x.n + y.s =                 since z and y are have the same tzinfo member,#                                     y.s = z.s by #2#     x.n + z.s# Plugging that back into [6] gives#     diff =#     x.n - ((x.n + z.s) - z.o) =     expanding#     x.n - x.n - z.s + z.o =         cancelling#     - z.s + z.o =                   by #2#     z.d# So diff = z.d.# If [5] is true now, diff = 0, so z.d = 0 too, and we have the standard-time# spelling we wanted in the endcase described above.  We're done.  Contrarily,# if z.d = 0, then we have a UTC equivalent, and are also done.# If [5] is not true now, diff = z.d != 0, and z.d is the offset we need to# add to z (in effect, z is in tz's standard time, and we need to shift the# local clock into tz's daylight time).# Let#     z' = z + z.d = z + diff                     [7]# and we can again ask whether#     z'.n - z'.o = x.n                           [8]# If so, we're done.  If not, the tzinfo class is insane, according to the# assumptions we've made.  This also requires a bit of proof.  As before, let's# compute the difference between the LHS and RHS of [8] (and skipping some of# the justifications for the kinds of substitutions we've done several times# already):#     diff' = x.n - (z'.n - z'.o) =           replacing z'.n via [7]#             x.n  - (z.n + diff - z'.o) =    replacing diff via [6]#             x.n - (z.n + x.n - (z.n - z.o) - z'.o) =#             x.n - z.n - x.n + z.n - z.o + z'.o =    cancel x.n#             - z.n + z.n - z.o + z'.o =              cancel z.n#             - z.o + z'.o =                      #1 twice#             -z.s - z.d + z'.s + z'.d =          z and z' have same tzinfo#             z'.d - z.d# So z' is UTC-equivalent to x iff z'.d = z.d at this point.  If they are equal,# we've found the UTC-equivalent so are done.  In fact, we stop with [7] and# return z', not bothering to compute z'.d.# How could z.d and z'd differ?  z' = z + z.d [7], so merely moving z' by# a dst() offset, and starting *from* a time already in DST (we know z.d != 0),# would have to change the result dst() returns:  we start in DST, and moving# a little further into it takes us out of DST.# There isn't a sane case where this can happen.  The closest it gets is at# the end of DST, where there's an hour in UTC with no spelling in a hybrid# tzinfo class.  In US Eastern, that's 5:MM UTC = 0:MM EST = 1:MM EDT.  During# that hour, on an Eastern clock 1:MM is taken as being in standard time (6:MM# UTC) because the docs insist on that, but 0:MM is taken as being in daylight# time (4:MM UTC).  There is no local time mapping to 5:MM UTC.  The local# clock jumps from 1:59 back to 1:00 again, and repeats the 1:MM hour in# standard time.  Since that's what the local clock *does*, we want to map both# UTC hours 5:MM and 6:MM to 1:MM Eastern.  The result is ambiguous# in local time, but so it goes -- it's the way the local clock works.# When x = 5:MM UTC is the input to this algorithm, x.o=0, y.o=-5 and y.d=0,# so z=0:MM.  z.d=60 (minutes) then, so [5] doesn't hold and we keep going.# z' = z + z.d = 1:MM then, and z'.d=0, and z'.d - z.d = -60 != 0 so [8]# (correctly) concludes that z' is not UTC-equivalent to x.# Because we know z.d said z was in daylight time (else [5] would have held and# we would have stopped then), and we know z.d != z'.d (else [8] would have held# and we have stopped then), and there are only 2 possible values dst() can# return in Eastern, it follows that z'.d must be 0 (which it is in the example,# but the reasoning doesn't depend on the example -- it depends on there being# two possible dst() outcomes, one zero and the other non-zero).  Therefore# z' must be in standard time, and is the spelling we want in this case.# Note again that z' is not UTC-equivalent as far as the hybrid tzinfo class is# concerned (because it takes z' as being in standard time rather than the# daylight time we intend here), but returning it gives the real-life "local# clock repeats an hour" behavior when mapping the "unspellable" UTC hour into# tz.# When the input is 6:MM, z=1:MM and z.d=0, and we stop at once, again with# the 1:MM standard time spelling we want.# So how can this break?  One of the assumptions must be violated.  Two# possibilities:# 1) [2] effectively says that y.s is invariant across all y belong to a given#    time zone.  This isn't true if, for political reasons or continental drift,#    a region decides to change its base offset from UTC.# 2) There may be versions of "double daylight" time where the tail end of#    the analysis gives up a step too early.  I haven't thought about that#    enough to say.# In any case, it's clear that the default fromutc() is strong enough to handle# "almost all" time zones:  so long as the standard offset is invariant, it# doesn't matter if daylight time transition points change from year to year, or# if daylight time is skipped in some years; it doesn't matter how large or# small dst() may get within its bounds; and it doesn't even matter if some# perverse time zone returns a negative dst()).  So a breaking case must be# pretty bizarre, and a tzinfo subclass can override fromutc() if it is.# Clean up unused names# XXX Since import * above excludes names that start with _,# docstring does not get overwritten.

    SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of
    any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic
    algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm
    published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
    hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
    elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.

    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
    catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
    to synching up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
    ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
    "junk" <wink>.

    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
    ...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
    ...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
    >>>

    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 3))
    0.866
    >>>

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:

    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
    ...     print("a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block)
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
    ...     print("%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode)
     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

    Methods:

    __init__(isjunk=None, a='', b='')
        Construct a SequenceMatcher.

    quick_ratio()
        Return an upper bound on .ratio() relatively quickly.

    real_quick_ratio()
        Return an upper bound on ratio() very quickly.
    isjunkautojunkConstruct a SequenceMatcher.

        Optional arg isjunk is None (the default), or a one-argument
        function that takes a sequence element and returns true iff the
        element is junk.  None is equivalent to passing "lambda x: 0", i.e.
        no elements are considered to be junk.  For example, pass
            lambda x: x in " \t"
        if you're comparing lines as sequences of characters, and don't
        want to synch up on blanks or hard tabs.

        Optional arg a is the first of two sequences to be compared.  By
        default, an empty string.  The elements of a must be hashable.  See
        also .set_seqs() and .set_seq1().

        Optional arg b is the second of two sequences to be compared.  By
        default, an empty string.  The elements of b must be hashable. See
        also .set_seqs() and .set_seq2().

        Optional arg autojunk should be set to False to disable the
        "automatic junk heuristic" that treats popular elements as junk
        (see module documentation for more information).
        set_seqsSet the two sequences to be compared.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher()
        >>> s.set_seqs("abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        set_seq1set_seq2Set the first sequence to be compared.

        The second sequence to be compared is not changed.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        >>> s.set_seq1("bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        1.0
        >>>

        SequenceMatcher computes and caches detailed information about the
        second sequence, so if you want to compare one sequence S against
        many sequences, use .set_seq2(S) once and call .set_seq1(x)
        repeatedly for each of the other sequences.

        See also set_seqs() and set_seq2().
        matching_blocksopcodesSet the second sequence to be compared.

        The first sequence to be compared is not changed.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        >>> s.set_seq2("abcd")
        >>> s.ratio()

        fullbcount__chain_bb2jbjunkjunkbpopularpopularntestidxsfind_longest_matchaloahiblobhiFind longest matching block in a[alo:ahi] and b[blo:bhi].

        If isjunk is not defined:

        Return (i,j,k) such that a[i:i+k] is equal to b[j:j+k], where
            alo <= i <= i+k <= ahi
            blo <= j <= j+k <= bhi
        and for all (i',j',k') meeting those conditions,
            k >= k'
            i <= i'
            and if i == i', j <= j'

        In other words, of all maximal matching blocks, return one that
        starts earliest in a, and of all those maximal matching blocks that
        start earliest in a, return the one that starts earliest in b.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, " abcd", "abcd abcd")
        >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 5, 0, 9)
        Match(a=0, b=4, size=5)

        If isjunk is defined, first the longest matching block is
        determined as above, but with the additional restriction that no
        junk element appears in the block.  Then that block is extended as
        far as possible by matching (only) junk elements on both sides.  So
        the resulting block never matches on junk except as identical junk
        happens to be adjacent to an "interesting" match.

        Here's the same example as before, but considering blanks to be
        junk.  That prevents " abcd" from matching the " abcd" at the tail
        end of the second sequence directly.  Instead only the "abcd" can
        match, and matches the leftmost "abcd" in the second sequence:

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x==" ", " abcd", "abcd abcd")
        >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 5, 0, 9)
        Match(a=1, b=0, size=4)

        If no blocks match, return (alo, blo, 0).

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "ab", "c")
        >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 2, 0, 1)
        Match(a=0, b=0, size=0)
        isbjunkbestibestjbestsizej2lennothingj2lengetnewj2lenget_matching_blocksReturn list of triples describing matching subsequences.

        Each triple is of the form (i, j, n), and means that
        a[i:i+n] == b[j:j+n].  The triples are monotonically increasing in
        i and in j.  New in Python 2.5, it's also guaranteed that if
        (i, j, n) and (i', j', n') are adjacent triples in the list, and
        the second is not the last triple in the list, then i+n != i' or
        j+n != j'.  IOW, adjacent triples never describe adjacent equal
        blocks.

        The last triple is a dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and is the only
        triple with n==0.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abxcd", "abcd")
        >>> list(s.get_matching_blocks())
        [Match(a=0, b=0, size=2), Match(a=3, b=2, size=2), Match(a=5, b=4, size=0)]
        lalbj1k1non_adjacentj2k2get_opcodesReturn list of 5-tuples describing how to turn a into b.

        Each tuple is of the form (tag, i1, i2, j1, j2).  The first tuple
        has i1 == j1 == 0, and remaining tuples have i1 == the i2 from the
        tuple preceding it, and likewise for j1 == the previous j2.

        The tags are strings, with these meanings:

        'replace':  a[i1:i2] should be replaced by b[j1:j2]
        'delete':   a[i1:i2] should be deleted.
                    Note that j1==j2 in this case.
        'insert':   b[j1:j2] should be inserted at a[i1:i1].
                    Note that i1==i2 in this case.
        'equal':    a[i1:i2] == b[j1:j2]

        >>> a = "qabxcd"
        >>> b = "abycdf"

        nnReturn a measure of the sequences' similarity (float in [0,1]).

        Where T is the total number of elements in both sequences, and
        M is the number of matches, this is 2.0*M / T.
        Note that this is 1 if the sequences are identical, and 0 if
        they have nothing in common.

        .ratio() is expensive to compute if you haven't already computed
        .get_matching_blocks() or .get_opcodes(), in which case you may
        want to try .quick_ratio() or .real_quick_ratio() first to get an
        upper bound.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        >>> s.quick_ratio()
        0.75
        >>> s.real_quick_ratio()
        1.0
        triplequick_ratioReturn an upper bound on ratio() relatively quickly.

        This isn't defined beyond that it is an upper bound on .ratio(), and
        is faster to compute.
        availavailhasnumbreal_quick_ratioReturn an upper bound on ratio() very quickly.

        This isn't defined beyond that it is an upper bound on .ratio(), and
        is faster to compute than either .ratio() or .quick_ratio().
        0.6possibilitiesUse SequenceMatcher to return list of the best "good enough" matches.

    word is a sequence for which close matches are desired (typically a
    string).

    possibilities is a list of sequences against which to match word
    (typically a list of strings).

    Optional arg n (default 3) is the maximum number of close matches to
    return.  n must be > 0.

    Optional arg cutoff (default 0.6) is a float in [0, 1].  Possibilities
    that don't score at least that similar to word are ignored.

    The best (no more than n) matches among the possibilities are returned
    in a list, sorted by similarity score, most similar first.

    >>> get_close_matches("appel", ["ape", "apple", "peach", "puppy"])
    ['apple', 'ape']
    >>> import keyword as _keyword
    >>> get_close_matches("wheel", _keyword.kwlist)
    ['while']
    >>> get_close_matches("Apple", _keyword.kwlist)
    []
    >>> get_close_matches("accept", _keyword.kwlist)
    ['except']
    n must be > 0: %rcutoff must be in [0.0, 1.0]: %rscore_keep_original_wstag_sReplace whitespace with the original whitespace characters in `s`tag_c
    Differ is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and
    producing human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses
    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:

        '- '    line unique to sequence 1
        '+ '    line unique to sequence 2
        '  '    line common to both sequences
        '? '    line not present in either input sequence

    Lines beginning with '? ' attempt to guide the eye to intraline
    differences, and were not present in either input sequence.  These lines
    can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.

    Note that Differ makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the
    contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch
    up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
    Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
    locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.

    Example: Comparing two texts.

    First we set up the texts, sequences of individual single-line strings
    ending with newlines (such sequences can also be obtained from the
    `readlines()` method of file-like objects):

    >>> text1 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    ...   3. Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)
    >>> len(text1)
    4
    >>> text1[0][-1]
    '\n'
    >>> text2 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ...   5. Flat is better than nested.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)

    Next we instantiate a Differ object:

    >>> d = Differ()

    Note that when instantiating a Differ object we may pass functions to
    filter out line and character 'junk'.  See Differ.__init__ for details.

    Finally, we compare the two:

    >>> result = list(d.compare(text1, text2))

    'result' is a list of strings, so let's pretty-print it:

    >>> from pprint import pprint as _pprint
    >>> _pprint(result)
    ['    1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
     '-   2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n',
     '-   3. Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '+   3.   Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '?     ++\n',
     '-   4. Complex is better than complicated.\n',
     '?            ^                     ---- ^\n',
     '+   4. Complicated is better than complex.\n',
     '?           ++++ ^                      ^\n',
     '+   5. Flat is better than nested.\n']

    As a single multi-line string it looks like this:

    >>> print(''.join(result), end="")
        1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    -   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    -   3. Simple is better than complex.
    +   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ?     ++
    -   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ?            ^                     ---- ^
    +   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ?           ++++ ^                      ^
    +   5. Flat is better than nested.

    Methods:

    __init__(linejunk=None, charjunk=None)
        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

    compare(a, b)
        Compare two sequences of lines; generate the resulting delta.
    linejunkcharjunk
        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

        The two optional keyword parameters are for filter functions:

        - `linejunk`: A function that should accept a single string argument,
          and return true iff the string is junk. The module-level function
          `IS_LINE_JUNK` may be used to filter out lines without visible
          characters, except for at most one splat ('#').  It is recommended
          to leave linejunk None; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has
          an adaptive notion of "noise" lines that's better than any static
          definition the author has ever been able to craft.

        - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The
          module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out
          whitespace characters (a blank or tab; **note**: bad idea to include
          newline in this!).  Use of IS_CHARACTER_JUNK is recommended.
        
        Compare two sequences of lines; generate the resulting delta.

        Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with
        newlines. Such sequences can be obtained from the `readlines()` method
        of file-like objects.  The delta generated also consists of newline-
        terminated strings, ready to be printed as-is via the writeline()
        method of a file-like object.

        Example:

        >>> print(''.join(Differ().compare('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(True),
        ...                                'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(True))),

        cruncher_fancy_replace_dumpGenerate comparison results for a same-tagged range._plain_replace
        When replacing one block of lines with another, search the blocks
        for *similar* lines; the best-matching pair (if any) is used as a
        synch point, and intraline difference marking is done on the
        similar pair. Lots of work, but often worth it.

        Example:

        >>> d = Differ()
        >>> results = d._fancy_replace(['abcDefghiJkl\n'], 0, 1,
        ...                            ['abcdefGhijkl\n'], 0, 1)
        >>> print(''.join(results), end="")
        - abcDefghiJkl
        ?    ^  ^  ^
        + abcdefGhijkl

        Format "?" output and deal with tabs.

        Example:

        >>> d = Differ()
        >>> results = d._qformat('\tabcDefghiJkl\n', '\tabcdefGhijkl\n',
        ...                      '  ^ ^  ^      ', '  ^ ^  ^      ')
        >>> for line in results: print(repr(line))
        ...
        '- \tabcDefghiJkl\n'
        '? \t ^ ^  ^\n'
        '+ \tabcdefGhijkl\n'
        '? \t ^ ^  ^\n'
        - ? + \s*(?:#\s*)?$
    Return True for ignorable line: iff `line` is blank or contains a single '#'.

    Examples:

    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('\n')
    True
    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('  #   \n')
    True
    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('hello\n')
    False
    
    Return True for ignorable character: iff `ch` is a space or tab.

    Examples:

    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK(' ')
    True
    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK('\t')
    True
    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK('\n')
    False
    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK('x')
    False
    _format_range_unifiedConvert range to the "ed" formatbeginning{},{}fromfiledatetofiledatelineterm
    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a unified diff.

    Unified diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with ---, +++, or @@) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
    argument to "" so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

    The unidiff format normally has a header for filenames and modification
    times.  Any or all of these may be specified using strings for
    'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.

    Example:

    >>> for line in unified_diff('one two three four'.split(),
    ...             'zero one tree four'.split(), 'Original', 'Current',
    ...             '2005-01-26 23:30:50', '2010-04-02 10:20:52',

    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a context diff.

    Context diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with *** or ---) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
    argument to "" so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

    The context diff format normally has a header for filenames and
    modification times.  Any or all of these may be specified using
    strings for 'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.
    If not specified, the strings default to blanks.

    Example:

    >>> print(''.join(context_diff('one\ntwo\nthree\nfour\n'.splitlines(True),
    ...       'zero\none\ntree\nfour\n'.splitlines(True), 'Original', 'Current')),

    Compare `a` and `b`, two sequences of lines represented as bytes rather
    than str. This is a wrapper for `dfunc`, which is typically either
    unified_diff() or context_diff(). Inputs are losslessly converted to
    strings so that `dfunc` only has to worry about strings, and encoded
    back to bytes on return. This is necessary to compare files with
    unknown or inconsistent encoding. All other inputs (except `n`) must be
    bytes rather than str.
    all arguments must be bytes, not %s (%r)
    Compare `a` and `b` (lists of strings); return a `Differ`-style delta.

    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter
    functions, or can be None:

    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument and
      return true iff the string is junk.  The default is None, and is
      recommended; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has an adaptive
      notion of "noise" lines.

    - charjunk: A function that accepts a character (string of length
      1), and returns true iff the character is junk. The default is
      the module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: it's a bad idea to
      include newline in this!).

    Tools/scripts/ndiff.py is a command-line front-end to this function.

    Example:

    >>> diff = ndiff('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(keepends=True),
    ...              'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(keepends=True))

    _mdifffromlinestolinesReturns generator yielding marked up from/to side by side differences.

    Arguments:
    fromlines -- list of text lines to compared to tolines
    tolines -- list of text lines to be compared to fromlines
    context -- number of context lines to display on each side of difference,
               if None, all from/to text lines will be generated.
    linejunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)
    charjunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)

    This function returns an iterator which returns a tuple:
    (from line tuple, to line tuple, boolean flag)

    from/to line tuple -- (line num, line text)
        line num -- integer or None (to indicate a context separation)
        line text -- original line text with following markers inserted:
            '\0+' -- marks start of added text
            '\0-' -- marks start of deleted text
            '\0^' -- marks start of changed text
            '\1' -- marks end of added/deleted/changed text

    boolean flag -- None indicates context separation, True indicates
        either "from" or "to" line contains a change, otherwise False.

    This function/iterator was originally developed to generate side by side
    file difference for making HTML pages (see HtmlDiff class for example
    usage).

    Note, this function utilizes the ndiff function to generate the side by
    side difference markup.  Optional ndiff arguments may be passed to this
    function and they in turn will be passed to ndiff.
    (\++|\-+|\^+)change_rediff_lines_iterator_make_lineformat_keysidenum_linesReturns line of text with user's change markup and line formatting.

        lines -- list of lines from the ndiff generator to produce a line of
                 text from.  When producing the line of text to return, the
                 lines used are removed from this list.
        format_key -- '+' return first line in list with "add" markup around
                          the entire line.
                      '-' return first line in list with "delete" markup around
                          the entire line.
                      '?' return first line in list with add/delete/change
                          intraline markup (indices obtained from second line)
                      None return first line in list with no markup
        side -- indice into the num_lines list (0=from,1=to)
        num_lines -- from/to current line number.  This is NOT intended to be a
                     passed parameter.  It is present as a keyword argument to
                     maintain memory of the current line numbers between calls
                     of this function.

        Note, this function is purposefully not defined at the module scope so
        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it
        is defined) does not need to be of module scope.
        sub_inforecord_sub_infomatch_object_line_iteratorYields from/to lines of text with a change indication.

        This function is an iterator.  It itself pulls lines from a
        differencing iterator, processes them and yields them.  When it can
        it yields both a "from" and a "to" line, otherwise it will yield one
        or the other.  In addition to yielding the lines of from/to text, a
        boolean flag is yielded to indicate if the text line(s) have
        differences in them.

        Note, this function is purposefully not defined at the module scope so
        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it
        is defined) does not need to be of module scope.
        num_blanks_pendingnum_blanks_to_yield-?+?--++--?+--+from_lineto_line-+?-?++--+-_line_pair_iteratorYields from/to lines of text with a change indication.

        This function is an iterator.  It itself pulls lines from the line
        iterator.  Its difference from that iterator is that this function
        always yields a pair of from/to text lines (with the change
        indication).  If necessary it will collect single from/to lines
        until it has a matching pair from/to pair to yield.

        Note, this function is purposefully not defined at the module scope so
        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it
        is defined) does not need to be of module scope.

    </table>_legendFor producing HTML side by side comparison with change highlights.

    This class can be used to create an HTML table (or a complete HTML file
    containing the table) showing a side by side, line by line comparison
    of text with inter-line and intra-line change highlights.  The table can
    be generated in either full or contextual difference mode.

    The following methods are provided for HTML generation:

    make_table -- generates HTML for a single side by side table
    make_file -- generates complete HTML file with a single side by side table

    See tools/scripts/diff.py for an example usage of this class.
    _default_prefixwrapcolumnHtmlDiff instance initializer

        Arguments:
        tabsize -- tab stop spacing, defaults to 8.
        wrapcolumn -- column number where lines are broken and wrapped,
            defaults to None where lines are not wrapped.
        linejunk,charjunk -- keyword arguments passed into ndiff() (used by
            HtmlDiff() to generate the side by side HTML differences).  See
            ndiff() documentation for argument default values and descriptions.
        _tabsize_wrapcolumn_linejunk_charjunkmake_filefromdesctodescnumlinesReturns HTML file of side by side comparison with change highlights

        Arguments:
        fromlines -- list of "from" lines
        tolines -- list of "to" lines
        fromdesc -- "from" file column header string
        todesc -- "to" file column header string
        context -- set to True for contextual differences (defaults to False
            which shows full differences).
        numlines -- number of context lines.  When context is set True,
            controls number of lines displayed before and after the change.
            When context is False, controls the number of lines to place
            the "next" link anchors before the next change (so click of
            "next" link jumps to just before the change).
        charset -- charset of the HTML document
        styleslegendmake_tabletable_tab_newline_replaceReturns from/to line lists with tabs expanded and newlines removed.

        Instead of tab characters being replaced by the number of spaces
        needed to fill in to the next tab stop, this function will fill
        the space with tab characters.  This is done so that the difference
        algorithms can identify changes in a file when tabs are replaced by
        spaces and vice versa.  At the end of the HTML generation, the tab
        characters will be replaced with a nonbreakable space.
        expand_tabs_split_linedata_listline_numBuilds list of text lines by splitting text lines at wrap point

        This function will determine if the input text line needs to be
        wrapped (split) into separate lines.  If so, the first wrap point
        will be determined and the first line appended to the output
        text line list.  This function is used recursively to handle
        the second part of the split line to further split it.
        line1line2_line_wrapperdiffsReturns iterator that splits (wraps) mdiff text linesfromdatatodatafromlinefromtexttolinetotext_collect_linesCollects mdiff output into separate lists

        Before storing the mdiff from/to data into a list, it is converted
        into a single line of text with HTML markup.
        flaglist_format_linelinenumReturns HTML markup of "from" / "to" text lines

        side -- 0 or 1 indicating "from" or "to" text
        flag -- indicates if difference on line
        linenum -- line number (used for line number column)
        text -- line text to be marked up

    Generate one of the two sequences that generated a delta.

    Given a `delta` produced by `Differ.compare()` or `ndiff()`, extract
    lines originating from file 1 or 2 (parameter `which`), stripping off line
    prefixes.

    Examples:

    >>> diff = ndiff('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(keepends=True),
    ...              'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(keepends=True))

    one

In particular,# "popular" non-junk elements aren't in b2j, which greatly speeds# the inner loop above, but also means "the best" match so far# doesn't contain any junk *or* popular non-junk elements.# Now that we have a wholly interesting match (albeit possibly# empty!), we may as well suck up the matching junk on each# side of it too.  Can't think of a good reason not to, and it# saves post-processing the (possibly considerable) expense of# figuring out what to do with it.  In the case of an empty# interesting match, this is clearly the right thing to do,# because no other kind of match is possible in the regions.# This is most naturally expressed as a recursive algorithm, but# at least one user bumped into extreme use cases that exceeded# the recursion limit on their box.

Remember the first block (k1==0 means it's# the dummy we started with), and make the second block the# new block to compare against.# invariant:  we've pumped out correct diffs to change# a[:i] into b[:j], and the next matching block is# a[ai:ai+size] == b[bj:bj+size].  So we need to pump# out a diff to change a[i:ai] into b[j:bj], pump out# the matching block, and move (i,j) beyond the match# the list of matching blocks is terminated by a# sentinel with size 0# Fixup leading and trailing groups if they show no changes.# End the current group and start a new one whenever# there is a large range with no changes.# viewing a and b as multisets, set matches to the cardinality# of their intersection; this counts the number of matches# without regard to order, so is clearly an upper bound# avail[x] is the number of times x appears in 'b' less the# number of times we've seen it in 'a' so far ... kinda# can't have more matches than the number of elements in the# shorter sequence# Move the best scorers to head of list# Strip scores for the best n matches# dump the shorter block first -- reduces the burden on short-term# memory if the blocks are of very different sizes# don't synch up unless the lines have a similarity score of at# least cutoff; best_ratio tracks the best score seen so far# 1st indices of equal lines (if any)# search for the pair that matches best without being identical# (identical lines must be junk lines, & we don't want to synch up# on junk -- unless we have to)# computing similarity is expensive, so use the quick# upper bounds first -- have seen this speed up messy# compares by a factor of 3.# note that ratio() is only expensive to compute the first# time it's called on a sequence pair; the expensive part# of the computation is cached by cruncher# no non-identical "pretty close" pair# no identical pair either -- treat it as a straight replace# no close pair, but an identical pair -- synch up on that# there's a close pair, so forget the identical pair (if any)# a[best_i] very similar to b[best_j]; eqi is None iff they're not# identical# pump out diffs from before the synch point# do intraline marking on the synch pair# pump out a '-', '?', '+', '?' quad for the synched lines# the synch pair is identical# pump out diffs from after the synch point# With respect to junk, an earlier version of ndiff simply refused to# *start* a match with a junk element.  The result was cases like this:#     before: private Thread currentThread;#     after:  private volatile Thread currentThread;# If you consider whitespace to be junk, the longest contiguous match# not starting with junk is "e Thread currentThread".  So ndiff reported# that "e volatil" was inserted between the 't' and the 'e' in "private".# While an accurate view, to people that's absurd.  The current version# looks for matching blocks that are entirely junk-free, then extends the# longest one of those as far as possible but only with matching junk.# So now "currentThread" is matched, then extended to suck up the# preceding blank; then "private" is matched, and extended to suck up the# following blank; then "Thread" is matched; and finally ndiff reports# that "volatile " was inserted before "Thread".  The only quibble# remaining is that perhaps it was really the case that " volatile"# was inserted after "private".

    SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of
    any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic
    algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm
    published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
    hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
    elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.

    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
    catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
    to synching up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
    ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
    "junk" <wink>.

    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
    ...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
    ...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
    >>>

    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 3))
    0.866
    >>>

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:

    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
    ...     print("a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block)
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
    ...     print("%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode)
     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

    Methods:

    __init__(isjunk=None, a='', b='')
        Construct a SequenceMatcher.

    set_seqs(a, b)
        Set the two sequences to be compared.

    get_matching_blocks()
        Return list of triples describing matching subsequences.

    get_opcodes()
        Return list of 5-tuples describing how to turn a into b.

    ratio()

    quick_ratio()
        Return an upper bound on .ratio() relatively quickly.

    real_quick_ratio()
        Return an upper bound on ratio() very quickly.

    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 3))
    0.866
    >>>

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:

    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
    ...     print("a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block)
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
    ...     print("%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode)
     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

    Differ is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and
    producing human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses
    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:

        '- '    line unique to sequence 1
        '+ '    line unique to sequence 2
        '  '    line common to both sequences
        '? '    line not present in either input sequence

    Lines beginning with '? ' attempt to guide the eye to intraline
    differences, and were not present in either input sequence.  These lines
    can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.

    Note that Differ makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the
    contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch
    up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
    Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
    locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.

    Example: Comparing two texts.

    First we set up the texts, sequences of individual single-line strings
    ending with newlines (such sequences can also be obtained from the
    `readlines()` method of file-like objects):

    >>> text1 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    ...   3. Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)
    >>> len(text1)
    4
    >>> text1[0][-1]
    '\n'
    >>> text2 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ...   5. Flat is better than nested.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)

    Next we instantiate a Differ object:

    >>> d = Differ()

    Note that when instantiating a Differ object we may pass functions to
    filter out line and character 'junk'.  See Differ.__init__ for details.

    Finally, we compare the two:

    >>> result = list(d.compare(text1, text2))

    'result' is a list of strings, so let's pretty-print it:

    >>> from pprint import pprint as _pprint
    >>> _pprint(result)
    ['    1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
     '-   2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n',
     '-   3. Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '+   3.   Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '?     ++\n',
     '-   4. Complex is better than complicated.\n',
     '?            ^                     ---- ^\n',
     '+   4. Complicated is better than complex.\n',
     '?           ++++ ^                      ^\n',
     '+   5. Flat is better than nested.\n']

    As a single multi-line string it looks like this:

    >>> print(''.join(result), end="")
        1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    -   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    -   3. Simple is better than complex.
    +   3.   Simple is better than complex.

    'b'
        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

        The two optional keyword parameters are for filter functions:

        - `linejunk`: A function that should accept a single string argument,
          and return true iff the string is junk. The module-level function
          `IS_LINE_JUNK` may be used to filter out lines without visible
          characters, except for at most one splat ('#').  It is recommended
          to leave linejunk None; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has
          an adaptive notion of "noise" lines that's better than any static
          definition the author has ever been able to craft.

        - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The
          module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out
          whitespace characters (a blank or tab; **note**: bad idea to include
          newline in this!).  Use of IS_CHARACTER_JUNK is recommended.

        Compare two sequences of lines; generate the resulting delta.

        Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with
        newlines. Such sequences can be obtained from the `readlines()` method
        of file-like objects.  The delta generated also consists of newline-
        terminated strings, ready to be printed as-is via the writeline()
        method of a file-like object.

        When replacing one block of lines with another, search the blocks
        for *similar* lines; the best-matching pair (if any) is used as a
        synch point, and intraline difference marking is done on the
        similar pair. Lots of work, but often worth it.

        Example:

    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a unified diff.

    Unified diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with ---, +++, or @@) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
    argument to "" so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

    The unidiff format normally has a header for filenames and modification
    times.  Any or all of these may be specified using strings for
    'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.

    strings for 'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.
    If not specified, the strings default to blanks.

    Example:

    >>> print(''.join(context_diff('one\ntwo\nthree\nfour\n'.splitlines(True),
    ...       'zero\none\ntree\nfour\n'.splitlines(True), 'Original', 'Current')),

    'u'
    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a context diff.

    Context diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with *** or ---) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
    argument to "" so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

    The context diff format normally has a header for filenames and
    modification times.  Any or all of these may be specified using
    strings for 'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.

    Compare `a` and `b`, two sequences of lines represented as bytes rather
    than str. This is a wrapper for `dfunc`, which is typically either
    unified_diff() or context_diff(). Inputs are losslessly converted to
    strings so that `dfunc` only has to worry about strings, and encoded
    back to bytes on return. This is necessary to compare files with
    unknown or inconsistent encoding. All other inputs (except `n`) must be
    bytes rather than str.

    Compare `a` and `b` (lists of strings); return a `Differ`-style delta.

    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter
    functions, or can be None:

    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument and
      return true iff the string is junk.  The default is None, and is
      recommended; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has an adaptive
      notion of "noise" lines.

    - charjunk: A function that accepts a character (string of length
      1), and returns true iff the character is junk. The default is
      the module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: it's a bad idea to
      include newline in this!).

    tolines -- list of text lines to be compared to fromlines
    context -- number of context lines to display on each side of difference,
               if None, all from/to text lines will be generated.
    linejunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)
    charjunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)

    This function returns an iterator which returns a tuple:
    (from line tuple, to line tuple, boolean flag)

    from/to line tuple -- (line num, line text)
        line num -- integer or None (to indicate a context separation)
        line text -- original line text with following markers inserted:
            '\0+' -- marks start of added text
            '\0-' -- marks start of deleted text
            '\0^' -- marks start of changed text
            '\1' -- marks end of added/deleted/changed text

    boolean flag -- None indicates context separation, True indicates
        either "from" or "to" line contains a change, otherwise False.

    This function/iterator was originally developed to generate side by side
    file difference for making HTML pages (see HtmlDiff class for example
    usage).

    Note, this function utilizes the ndiff function to generate the side by
    side difference markup.  Optional ndiff arguments may be passed to this
    function and they in turn will be passed to ndiff.

        boolean flag is yielded to indicate if the text line(s) have
        differences in them.

    </table>'b'For producing HTML side by side comparison with change highlights.

    This class can be used to create an HTML table (or a complete HTML file
    containing the table) showing a side by side, line by line comparison
    of text with inter-line and intra-line change highlights.  The table can
    be generated in either full or contextual difference mode.

    The following methods are provided for HTML generation:

    make_table -- generates HTML for a single side by side table
    make_file -- generates complete HTML file with a single side by side table

========
DKIM-IDs
========

The recommended Ponymail ID generator is the DKIM-ID generator. It
simplifies a message using an algorithm based on DKIM relaxed/simple
canonicalisation, hashes it with an SHA-256 HMAC, and then encodes the
truncated digest using base32 with the custom alphabet ``0-9 b-d f-h
j-t v-z`` and the padding stripped.


DKIM-IDs test suite
===================

As well as plain Python doctests, we also use the hypothesis package
to check properties of the DKIM-ID generator algorithm. This has the
advantage of providing a kind of partial specification as well as
testing the code. The suite can be run using::

    PYTHONPATH=../tools python3 dkim_id_test.py

And exported to HTML using docutils and the command::

    HTML=1 PYTHONPATH=../tools \
        python3 dkim_id_test.py > dkim_id_test.html


RFC5322 line ending normalisation
---------------------------------

The first step of generating a DKIM-ID is to convert all line endings
of the input to CRLF by upgrading bare CR and LF characters.

  If the message is submitted to the Signer with any local encoding
  that will be modified before transmission, that modification to
  canonical [RFC5322] form MUST be done before signing. In particular,
  bare CR or LF characters (used by some systems as a local line
  separator convention) MUST be converted to the SMTP-standard CRLF
  sequence before the message is signed.

  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376#section-5.3

We follow the algorithm used in dkim_header in dkim.c in version 2.10
of libopendkim, the implementation of which is this, reformatted for
brevity::

  for (p = hdr; p < q && *p != '\0'; p++) {
    if (*p == '\n' && prev != '\r') { /* bare LF */
      dkim_dstring_catn(tmphdr, CRLF, 2);
    } else if (prev == '\r' && *p != '\n') { /* bare CR */
      dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, '\n');
      dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, *p);
    } else { /* other */
      dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, *p);
    }
    prev = *p;
  }
  if (prev == '\r') { /* end CR */
    dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, '\n');
  }

Our version of this algorithm is called ``rfc5322_endings``.

>>> from dkim_id import rfc5322_endings

It works on bytes and produces bytes.

We test properties of the DKIM-ID related functions not by formally
proving them, as there are no mainstream frameworks for formal
verification of Python (though Nagini may be worth trying), but
instead by fuzzing with hypothesis as a property checker.

>>> from hypothesis import given
>>> from hypothesis.strategies import from_regex as regex, text

The regex producer outputs str instances, and we use it because
hypothesis does not allow us to use patterns or other smart generation
with only bytes. Therefore we use the smart str generators and then
convert the output to bytes using cp1252 or utf-8 encoding as
necessary.

>>> def cp1252(text: str) -> bytes:
...     return bytes(text, "cp1252")
>>> def utf8(text: str):
...     return bytes(text, "utf-8")

We'll also use our own decorator to make tests run automatically.

>>> def thesis(hypo, *args):
...     def decorator(func):
...         func = hypo(*args)(func)
...         func()
...         return func
...     return decorator

Since ``rfc5322_endings`` only converts endings, sequences containing
neither CR nor LF are unaffected.

>>> @thesis(given, regex(r"\A[^\r\n]*\Z"))
... def non_cr_lf_unaffected(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = utf8(text)
...     assert data == rfc5322_endings(data), repr(data)

The algorithm is that any LF not preceded with CR will have one
inserted before it, and likewise for CR not followed by LF. Therefore
we expect the result to always have the same number of CR and LFs.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def cr_lf_same_cardinality(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = rfc5322_endings(utf8(text))
...     crs = data.count(b"\r")
...     lfs = data.count(b"\n")
...     assert crs == lfs, repr(data)

That the number of CRs or LFs will never be reduced.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def cr_lf_no_reduce(text: str) -> None:
...     a: bytes = utf8(text)
...     b: bytes = rfc5322_endings(a)
...     assert b.count(b"\r") >= a.count(b"\r"), repr(data)
...     assert b.count(b"\n") >= a.count(b"\n"), repr(data)

That if we delete all CRLF subsequences, there will be no CR or LFs
remaining in the sequence.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def only_crlf_subsequences(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = rfc5322_endings(utf8(text))
...     data = data.replace(b"\r\n", b".")
...     assert data.count(b"\r") == 0, repr(data)
...     assert data.count(b"\n") == 0, repr(data)

That if we split on CR or LF sequences, the input and output will be
the same.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\nabc. "))
... def non_crlf_subsequences(text: str) -> None:
...     def split(data: bytes):
...         data = data.replace(b"\r", b"\n")
...         while b"\n\n" in data:
...             data = data.replace(b"\n\n", b"\n")
...         return data.strip(b"\n").split(b"\n")
...     data: bytes = utf8(text)
...     expected = split(data)
...     normed: bytes = rfc5322_endings(data)
...     assert split(normed) == expected, repr(data)

And that all of this is equivalent to saying that every CR is now
followed by LF and every LF is preceded by CR.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def cr_and_lf_pairs(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = rfc5322_endings(utf8(text))
...     if b"\r" in data:
...         datum: bytes
...         for datum in data.split(b"\r")[1:]:
...             assert datum.startswith(b"\n"), repr(data)
...     if b"\n" in data:
...         datum: bytes
...         for datum in data.split(b"\n")[:-1]:
...             assert datum.endswith(b"\r"), repr(data)

Most importantly, the number of CRLFs in the output must be equal to
the number of CRLFs in the input, plus the number of individual CRs
and LFs once the CRLFs have been removed.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def crlf_count(text: str) -> None:
...     nocrlf = text.replace("\r\n", "")
...     expected = text.count("\r\n")
...     expected += nocrlf.count("\r")
...     expected += nocrlf.count("\n")
...     data: bytes = rfc5322_endings(utf8(text))
...     assert data.count(b"\r\n") == expected, repr(text)

We'll now give a few examples. First, with no CR or LF.

>>> rfc5322_endings(b"")
b''
>>> rfc5322_endings(b"abc")
b'abc'

All of the following are equivalent to CRLF.

>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\r")
b'\r\n'
>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\n")
b'\r\n'
>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\r\n")
b'\r\n'

And the following are equivalent to CRLF CRLF.

>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\r\r")
b'\r\n\r\n'
>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\n\n")
b'\r\n\r\n'
>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\n\r")
b'\r\n\r\n'


DKIM relaxed head canonicalisation
----------------------------------

The next important component of DKIM-ID generation is DKIM head
canonicalisation using the relaxed canonicalisation algorithm. The
algorithm is not trivial, consisting of five separate steps:

  * Convert all header field names (not the header field values) to
    lowercase. For example, convert "SUBJect: AbC" to "subject: AbC".

  * Unfold all header field continuation lines as described in
    [RFC5322]; in particular, lines with terminators embedded in
    continued header field values (that is, CRLF sequences followed by
    WSP) MUST be interpreted without the CRLF. Implementations MUST
    NOT remove the CRLF at the end of the header field value.

  * Convert all sequences of one or more WSP characters to a single SP
    character. WSP characters here include those before and after a
    line folding boundary.

  * Delete all WSP characters at the end of each unfolded header field
    value.

  * Delete any WSP characters remaining before and after the colon
    separating the header field name from the header field value. The
    colon separator MUST be retained.

  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376#section-3.4.2

We'll use hypothesis to check each of these properties in turn. The
canonicalisation function is called ``rfc6376_relaxed_head``.

>>> from dkim_id import rfc6376_relaxed_head

And to test it, we'll need the lists producer from hypothesis.

>>> from hypothesis.strategies import lists
>>> chars = text(alphabet="\x00\t\r\n\f .ABCabc\xc0").map(cp1252)
>>> headers = lists(lists(chars, min_size=2, max_size=2))


Step one
~~~~~~~~

Step one is to convert header field names only to lowercase. Since
other normalisation steps will occur, to test it we need to take only
the alphabetical octets.

>>> def alphabetical(data: bytes) -> bytes:
...    from typing import Set
...    upper: bytes = b"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
...    alpha: Set[int] = set(upper + upper.lower())
...    return bytes([b for b in data if b in alpha])

Then we can make a direct comparison.

>>> @thesis(given, headers)
... def step_1_field_names_lower(headers) -> None:
...     ks = [alphabetical(kv[0]) for kv in headers]
...     for i, (k, v) in enumerate(rfc6376_relaxed_head(headers)):
...         assert ks[i].lower() == alphabetical(k), repr(headers)

Including that values use the same case.

>>> @thesis(given, headers)
... def step_1_field_values_case(headers) -> None:
...     vs = [kv[1] for kv in headers]
...     alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
...     cases = set(alpha + alpha.lower())
...     for i, (k, v) in enumerate(rfc6376_relaxed_head(headers)):
...         assert (set(vs[i]) & cases) == (set(v) & cases), repr(headers)


Step two
~~~~~~~~

Step two is to unfold continuations by removing CRLF except at the
end. This would only produce consistent results if the value is in
``rfc5322_endings`` normal form, so we extend the step to remove all
CR or LF, except for a trailing CRLF in the header field value.

>>> rfc6376_relaxed_head([[b"", b"\r"]])
[[b'', b'']]
>>> rfc6376_relaxed_head([[b"", b"\n"]])
[[b'', b'']]
>>> rfc6376_relaxed_head([[b"", b"\r\n"]])
[[b'', b'\r\n']]
>>> rfc6376_relaxed_head([[b"", b"...\r"]])
[[b'', b'...']]

DKIM-IDs
========

The recommended Ponymail ID generator is the DKIM-ID generator. It
simplifies a message using an algorithm based on DKIM relaxed/simple
canonicalisation, hashes it with an SHA-256 HMAC, and then encodes the
truncated digest using base32 with the custom alphabet ``0-9 b-d f-h
j-t v-z`` and the padding stripped.


DKIM-IDs test suite
===================

As well as plain Python doctests, we also use the hypothesis package
to check properties of the DKIM-ID generator algorithm. This has the
advantage of providing a kind of partial specification as well as
testing the code. The suite can be run using::

    PYTHONPATH=../tools python3 dkim_id_test.py

And exported to HTML using docutils and the command::

    HTML=1 PYTHONPATH=../tools \
        python3 dkim_id_test.py > dkim_id_test.html


RFC5322 line ending normalisation
---------------------------------

The first step of generating a DKIM-ID is to convert all line endings
of the input to CRLF by upgrading bare CR and LF characters.

  If the message is submitted to the Signer with any local encoding
  that will be modified before transmission, that modification to
  canonical [RFC5322] form MUST be done before signing. In particular,
  bare CR or LF characters (used by some systems as a local line
  separator convention) MUST be converted to the SMTP-standard CRLF
  sequence before the message is signed.

  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376#section-5.3

We follow the algorithm used in dkim_header in dkim.c in version 2.10
of libopendkim, the implementation of which is this, reformatted for
brevity::

  for (p = hdr; p < q && *p != '\0'; p++) {
    if (*p == '\n' && prev != '\r') { /* bare LF */
      dkim_dstring_catn(tmphdr, CRLF, 2);
    } else if (prev == '\r' && *p != '\n') { /* bare CR */
      dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, '\n');
      dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, *p);
    } else { /* other */
      dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, *p);
    }
    prev = *p;
  }
  if (prev == '\r') { /* end CR */
    dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, '\n');
  }

Our version of this algorithm is called ``rfc5322_endings``.

>>> from dkim_id import rfc5322_endings

It works on bytes and produces bytes.

We test properties of the DKIM-ID related functions not by formally
proving them, as there are no mainstream frameworks for formal
verification of Python (though Nagini may be worth trying), but
instead by fuzzing with hypothesis as a property checker.

>>> from hypothesis import given
>>> from hypothesis.strategies import from_regex as regex, text

The regex producer outputs str instances, and we use it because
hypothesis does not allow us to use patterns or other smart generation
with only bytes. Therefore we use the smart str generators and then
convert the output to bytes using cp1252 or utf-8 encoding as
necessary.

>>> def cp1252(text: str) -> bytes:
...     return bytes(text, "cp1252")
>>> def utf8(text: str):
...     return bytes(text, "utf-8")

We'll also use our own decorator to make tests run automatically.

>>> def thesis(hypo, *args):
...     def decorator(func):
...         func = hypo(*args)(func)
...         func()
...         return func
...     return decorator

Since ``rfc5322_endings`` only converts endings, sequences containing
neither CR nor LF are unaffected.

>>> @thesis(given, regex(r"\A[^\r\n]*\Z"))
... def non_cr_lf_unaffected(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = utf8(text)
...     assert data == rfc5322_endings(data), repr(data)

The algorithm is that any LF not preceded with CR will have one
inserted before it, and likewise for CR not followed by LF. Therefore
we expect the result to always have the same number of CR and LFs.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def cr_lf_same_cardinality(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = rfc5322_endings(utf8(text))
...     crs = data.count(b"\r")
...     lfs = data.count(b"\n")
...     assert crs == lfs, repr(data)

That the number of CRs or LFs will never be reduced.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def cr_lf_no_reduce(text: str) -> None:
...     a: bytes = utf8(text)
...     b: bytes = rfc5322_endings(a)
...     assert b.count(b"\r") >= a.count(b"\r"), repr(data)
...     assert b.count(b"\n") >= a.count(b"\n"), repr(data)

That if we delete all CRLF subsequences, there will be no CR or LFs
remaining in the sequence.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def only_crlf_subsequences(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = rfc5322_endings(utf8(text))
...     data = data.replace(b"\r\n", b".")
...     assert data.count(b"\r") == 0, repr(data)
...     assert data.count(b"\n") == 0, repr(data)

That if we split on CR or LF sequences, the input and output will be
the same.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\nabc. "))
... def non_crlf_subsequences(text: str) -> None:
...     def split(data: bytes):
...         data = data.replace(b"\r", b"\n")

...     expected = split(data)
...     normed: bytes = rfc5322_endings(data)
...     assert split(normed) == expected, repr(data)

And that all of this is equivalent to saying that every CR is now

Most importantly, the number of CRLFs in the output must be equal to

We follow the algorithm used in dkim_header in dkim.c in version 2.10
of libopendkim, the implementation of which is this, reformatted for
brevity::

  for (p = hdr; p < q && *p != '\0'; p++) {
    if (*p == '\n' && prev != '\r') { /* bare LF */
      dkim_dstring_catn(tmphdr, CRLF, 2);
    } else if (prev == '\r' && *p != '\n') { /* bare CR */
      dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, '\n');
      dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, *p);
    } else { /* other */
      dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, *p);
    }
    prev = *p;
  }
  if (prev == '\r') { /* end CR */
    dkim_dstring_cat1(tmphdr, '\n');
  }

Our version of this algorithm is called ``rfc5322_endings``.

>>> from dkim_id import rfc5322_endings

It works on bytes and produces bytes.

We test properties of the DKIM-ID related functions not by formally
proving them, as there are no mainstream frameworks for formal
verification of Python (though Nagini may be worth trying), but
instead by fuzzing with hypothesis as a property checker.

>>> from hypothesis import given
>>> from hypothesis.strategies import from_regex as regex, text

The regex producer outputs str instances, and we use it because
hypothesis does not allow us to use patterns or other smart generation
with only bytes. Therefore we use the smart str generators and then
convert the output to bytes using cp1252 or utf-8 encoding as
necessary.

>>> def cp1252(text: str) -> bytes:
...     return bytes(text, "cp1252")
>>> def utf8(text: str):
...     return bytes(text, "utf-8")

We'll also use our own decorator to make tests run automatically.

>>> def thesis(hypo, *args):
...     def decorator(func):
...         func = hypo(*args)(func)
...         func()
...         return func
...     return decorator

Since ``rfc5322_endings`` only converts endings, sequences containing
neither CR nor LF are unaffected.

>>> @thesis(given, regex(r"\A[^\r\n]*\Z"))
... def non_cr_lf_unaffected(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = utf8(text)
...     assert data == rfc5322_endings(data), repr(data)

The algorithm is that any LF not preceded with CR will have one
inserted before it, and likewise for CR not followed by LF. Therefore
we expect the result to always have the same number of CR and LFs.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def cr_lf_same_cardinality(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = rfc5322_endings(utf8(text))
...     crs = data.count(b"\r")
...     lfs = data.count(b"\n")
...     assert crs == lfs, repr(data)

That the number of CRs or LFs will never be reduced.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def cr_lf_no_reduce(text: str) -> None:
...     a: bytes = utf8(text)
...     b: bytes = rfc5322_endings(a)
...     assert b.count(b"\r") >= a.count(b"\r"), repr(data)
...     assert b.count(b"\n") >= a.count(b"\n"), repr(data)

That if we delete all CRLF subsequences, there will be no CR or LFs
remaining in the sequence.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def only_crlf_subsequences(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = rfc5322_endings(utf8(text))
...     data = data.replace(b"\r\n", b".")
...     assert data.count(b"\r") == 0, repr(data)
...     assert data.count(b"\n") == 0, repr(data)

That if we split on CR or LF sequences, the input and output will be
the same.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\nabc. "))
... def non_crlf_subsequences(text: str) -> None:
...     def split(data: bytes):
...         data = data.replace(b"\r", b"\n")
...         while b"\n\n" in data:
...             data = data.replace(b"\n\n", b"\n")
...         return data.strip(b"\n").split(b"\n")
...     data: bytes = utf8(text)
...     expected = split(data)
...     normed: bytes = rfc5322_endings(data)
...     assert split(normed) == expected, repr(data)

And that all of this is equivalent to saying that every CR is now
followed by LF and every LF is preceded by CR.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def cr_and_lf_pairs(text: str) -> None:
...     data: bytes = rfc5322_endings(utf8(text))
...     if b"\r" in data:
...         datum: bytes
...         for datum in data.split(b"\r")[1:]:
...             assert datum.startswith(b"\n"), repr(data)
...     if b"\n" in data:
...         datum: bytes
...         for datum in data.split(b"\n")[:-1]:
...             assert datum.endswith(b"\r"), repr(data)

Most importantly, the number of CRLFs in the output must be equal to
the number of CRLFs in the input, plus the number of individual CRs
and LFs once the CRLFs have been removed.

>>> @thesis(given, text(alphabet="\r\n."))
... def crlf_count(text: str) -> None:
...     nocrlf = text.replace("\r\n", "")
...     expected = text.count("\r\n")
...     expected += nocrlf.count("\r")
...     expected += nocrlf.count("\n")
...     data: bytes = rfc5322_endings(utf8(text))
...     assert data.count(b"\r\n") == expected, repr(text)

We'll now give a few examples. First, with no CR or LF.

>>> rfc5322_endings(b"")
b''
>>> rfc5322_endings(b"abc")
b'abc'

All of the following are equivalent to CRLF.

>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\r")
b'\r\n'
>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\n")
b'\r\n'
>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\r\n")
b'\r\n'

And the following are equivalent to CRLF CRLF.

>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\r\r")
b'\r\n\r\n'
>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\n\n")
b'\r\n\r\n'
>>> rfc5322_endings(b"\n\r")
b'\r\n\r\n'


DKIM relaxed head canonicalisation
----------------------------------

The next important component of DKIM-ID generation is DKIM head
canonicalisation using the relaxed canonicalisation algorithm. The
algorithm is not trivial, consisting of five separate steps:

  * Convert all header field names (not the header field values) to
    lowercase. For example, convert "SUBJect: AbC" to "subject: AbC".

  * Unfold all header field continuation lines as described in
    [RFC5322]; in particular, lines with terminators embedded in
    continued header field values (that is, CRLF sequences followed by
    WSP) MUST be interpreted without the CRLF. Implementations MUST
    NOT remove the CRLF at the end of the header field value.

  * Convert all sequences of one or more WSP characters to a single SP
    character. WSP characters here include those before and after a
    line folding boundary.

  * Delete all WSP characters at the end of each unfolded header field
    value.

  * Delete any WSP characters remaining before and after the colon
    separating the header field name from the header field value. The
    colon separator MUST be retained.

  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376#section-3.4.2

We'll use hypothesis to check each of these properties in turn. The
canonicalisation function is called ``rfc6376_relaxed_head``.

>>> from dkim_id import rfc6376_relaxed_head

And to test it, we'll need the lists producer from hypothesis.

>>> from hypothesis.strategies import lists
>>> chars = text(alphabet="\x00\t\r\n\f .ABCabc\xc0").map(cp1252)
>>> headers = lists(lists(chars, min_size=2, max_size=2))


Step one
~~~~~~~~

Step one is to convert header field names only to lowercase. Since
other normalisation steps will occur, to test it we need to take only
the alphabetical octets.

>>> def alphabetical(data: bytes) -> bytes:
...    from typing import Set
...    upper: bytes = b"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
...    alpha: Set[int] = set(upper + upper.lower())
...    return bytes([b for b in data if b in alpha])

Then we can make a direct comparison.

>>> @thesis(given, headers)
... def step_1_field_names_lower(headers) -> None:
...     ks = [alphabetical(kv[0]) for kv in headers]
...     for i, (k, v) in enumerate(rfc6376_relaxed_head(headers)):
...         assert ks[i].lower() == alphabetical(k), repr(headers)

Including that values use the same case.

>>> @thesis(given, headers)
... def step_1_field_values_case(headers) -> None:
...     vs = [kv[1] for kv in headers]
...     alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
...     cases = set(alpha + alpha.lower())
...     for i, (k, v) in enumerate(rfc6376_relaxed_head(headers)):
...         assert (set(vs[i]) & cases) == (set(v) & cases), repr(headers)


Step two
~~~~~~~~

Step two is to unfold continuations by removing CRLF except at the
end. This would only produce consistent results if the value is in
``rfc5322_endings`` normal form, so we extend the step to remove all
CR or LF, except for a trailing CRLF in the header field value.

>>> rfc6376_relaxed_head([[b"", b"\r"]])
[[b'', b'']]
>>> rfc6376_relaxed_head([[b"", b"\n"]])
[[b'', b'']]
>>> rfc6376_relaxed_head([[b"", b"\r\n"]])
[[b'', b'\r\n']]
>>> rfc6376_relaxed_head([[b"", b"...\r"]])
[[b'', b'...']]
>>> rfc6376_...b'To: Value

In simplest use, end each module M to be tested with:

def _test():
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()

Then running the module as a script will cause the examples in the
docstrings to get executed and verified:

python M.py

This won't display anything unless an example fails, in which case the
failing example(s) and the cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout
(why not stderr? because stderr is a lame hack <0.2 wink>), and the final
line of output is "Test failed.".

Run it with the -v switch instead:

python M.py -v

and a detailed report of all examples tried is printed to stdout, along
with assorted summaries at the end.

You can force verbose mode by passing "verbose=True" to testmod, or prohibit
it by passing "verbose=False".  In either of those cases, sys.argv is not
examined by testmod.

There are a variety of other ways to run doctests, including integration
with the unittest framework, and support for running non-Python text
files containing doctests.  There are also many ways to override parts
of doctest's default behaviors.  See the Library Reference Manual for
details.

    A single doctest example, consisting of source code and expected
    output.  `Example` defines the following attributes:

      - source: A single Python statement, always ending with a newline.
        The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - want: The expected output from running the source code (either
        from stdout, or a traceback in case of exception).  `want` ends
        with a newline unless it's empty, in which case it's an empty
        string.  The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - exc_msg: The exception message generated by the example, if
        the example is expected to generate an exception; or `None` if
        it is not expected to generate an exception.  This exception
        message is compared against the return value of
        `traceback.format_exception_only()`.  `exc_msg` ends with a
        newline unless it's `None`.  The constructor adds a newline
        if needed.

      - lineno: The line number within the DocTest string containing
        this Example where the Example begins.  This line number is
        zero-based, with respect to the beginning of the DocTest.

      - indent: The example's indentation in the DocTest string.
        I.e., the number of space characters that precede the
        example's first prompt.

      - options: A dictionary mapping from option flags to True or
        False, which is used to override default options for this
        example.  Any option flags not contained in this dictionary
        are left at their default value (as specified by the
        DocTestRunner's optionflags).  By default, no options are set.
    exc_msg
    A collection of doctest examples that should be run in a single
    namespace.  Each `DocTest` defines the following attributes:

      - examples: the list of examples.

      - globs: The namespace (aka globals) that the examples should
        be run in.

      - name: A name identifying the DocTest (typically, the name of
        the object whose docstring this DocTest was extracted from).

      - filename: The name of the file that this DocTest was extracted
        from, or `None` if the filename is unknown.

      - lineno: The line number within filename where this DocTest
        begins, or `None` if the line number is unavailable.  This
        line number is zero-based, with respect to the beginning of
        the file.

      - docstring: The string that the examples were extracted from,
        or `None` if the string is unavailable.

        The optional argument `parser` specifies a class or
        function that should be used to create new DocTest objects (or
        objects that implement the same interface as DocTest).  The
        signature for this factory function should match the signature
        of the DocTest constructor.

        If the optional argument `recurse` is false, then `find` will
        only examine the given object, and not any contained objects.

        If the optional argument `exclude_empty` is false, then `find`
        will include tests for objects with empty docstrings.
        _verbose_recurse_exclude_emptyextraglobs
        Return a list of the DocTests that are defined by the given
        object's docstring, or by any of its contained objects'
        docstrings.

        The optional parameter `module` is the module that contains
        the given object.  If the module is not specified or is None, then
        the test finder will attempt to automatically determine the
        correct module.  The object's module is used:

            - As a default namespace, if `globs` is not specified.
            - To prevent the DocTestFinder from extracting DocTests
              from objects that are imported from other modules.
            - To find the name of the file containing the object.
            - To help find the line number of the object within its
              file.

        Contained objects whose module does not match `module` are ignored.

        If `module` is False, no attempt to find the module will be made.
        This is obscure, of use mostly in tests:  if `module` is False, or
        is None but cannot be found automatically, then all objects are
        considered to belong to the (non-existent) module, so all contained
        objects will (recursively) be searched for doctests.

        The globals for each DocTest is formed by combining `globs`
        and `extraglobs` (bindings in `extraglobs` override bindings
        in `globs`).  A new copy of the globals dictionary is created
        for each DocTest.  If `globs` is not specified, then it
        defaults to the module's `__dict__`, if specified, or {}
        otherwise.  If `extraglobs` is not specified, then it defaults
        to {}.

        Return a DocTest for the given object, if it defines a docstring;
        otherwise, return None.
        _find_lineno
        Return a line number of the given object's docstring.  Note:

        ^\s*class\s*%s\bismethodistracebackisframeiscode(^|.*:)\s*\w*("|\')
    A class used to run DocTest test cases, and accumulate statistics.
    The `run` method is used to process a single DocTest case.  It
    returns a tuple `(f, t)`, where `t` is the number of test cases
    tried, and `f` is the number of test cases that failed.

        >>> tests = DocTestFinder().find(_TestClass)
        >>> runner = DocTestRunner(verbose=False)
        >>> tests.sort(key = lambda test: test.name)
        >>> for test in tests:
        ...     print(test.name, '->', runner.run(test))
        _TestClass -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.__init__ -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.get -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.square -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=1)

    The `summarize` method prints a summary of all the test cases that
    have been run by the runner, and returns an aggregated `(f, t)`
    tuple:

        >>> runner.summarize(verbose=1)
        4 items passed all tests:
           2 tests in _TestClass
           2 tests in _TestClass.__init__
           2 tests in _TestClass.get
           1 tests in _TestClass.square
        7 tests in 4 items.
        7 passed and 0 failed.
        Test passed.
        TestResults(failed=0, attempted=7)

    The aggregated number of tried examples and failed examples is
    also available via the `tries` and `failures` attributes:

        >>> runner.tries
        7
        >>> runner.failures
        0

    The comparison between expected outputs and actual outputs is done
    by an `OutputChecker`.  This comparison may be customized with a
    number of option flags; see the documentation for `testmod` for
    more information.  If the option flags are insufficient, then the
    comparison may also be customized by passing a subclass of
    `OutputChecker` to the constructor.

    The test runner's display output can be controlled in two ways.
    First, an output function (`out) can be passed to
    `TestRunner.run`; this function will be called with strings that
    should be displayed.  It defaults to `sys.stdout.write`.  If
    capturing the output is not sufficient, then the display output
    can be also customized by subclassing DocTestRunner, and
    overriding the methods `report_start`, `report_success`,
    `report_unexpected_exception`, and `report_failure`.
    DIVIDERchecker
        Create a new test runner.

        Optional keyword arg `checker` is the `OutputChecker` that
        should be used to compare the expected outputs and actual
        outputs of doctest examples.

        Optional keyword arg 'verbose' prints lots of stuff if true,
        only failures if false; by default, it's true iff '-v' is in
        sys.argv.

        Optional argument `optionflags` can be used to control how the
        test runner compares expected output to actual output, and how
        it displays failures.  See the documentation for `testmod` for
        more information.

        Run the examples in `test`.  Write the outcome of each example
        with one of the `DocTestRunner.report_*` methods, using the
        writer function `out`.  `compileflags` is the set of compiler
        flags that should be used to execute examples.  Return a tuple
        `(f, t)`, where `t` is the number of examples tried, and `f`
        is the number of examples that failed.  The examples are run
        in the namespace `test.globs`.

        Run the examples in `test`, and display the results using the
        writer function `out`.

        The examples are run in the namespace `test.globs`.  If
        `clear_globs` is true (the default), then this namespace will
        be cleared after the test runs, to help with garbage
        collection.  If you would like to examine the namespace after
        the test completes, then use `clear_globs=False`.

        `compileflags` gives the set of flags that should be used by
        the Python compiler when running the examples.  If not
        specified, then it will default to the set of future-import
        flags that apply to `globs`.

        The output of each example is checked using
        `DocTestRunner.check_output`, and the results are formatted by
        the `DocTestRunner.report_*` methods.
        save_tracesave_set_tracesave_displayhooksummarize
        Print a summary of all the test cases that have been run by
        this DocTestRunner, and return a tuple `(f, t)`, where `f` is
        the total number of failed examples, and `t` is the total
        number of tried examples.

        The optional `verbose` argument controls how detailed the
        summary is.  If the verbosity is not specified, then the
        DocTestRunner's verbosity is used.

    A class used to check the whether the actual output from a doctest
    example matches the expected output.  `OutputChecker` defines two
    methods: `check_output`, which compares a given pair of outputs,
    and returns true if they match; and `output_difference`, which
    returns a string describing the differences between two outputs.
    _toAscii
        Convert string to hex-escaped ASCII string.
        
        Return True iff the actual output from an example (`got`)
        matches the expected output (`want`).  These strings are
        always considered to match if they are identical; but
        depending on what option flags the test runner is using,
        several non-exact match types are also possible.  See the
        documentation for `TestRunner` for more information about
        option flags.

A DocTest example has failed in debugging mode.

    The exception instance has variables:

    - test: the DocTest object being run

    - example: the Example object that failed

    - got: the actual output
    A DocTest example has encountered an unexpected exception

    The exception instance has variables:

    - test: the DocTest object being run

    - example: the Example object that failed

    - exc_info: the exception info
    Run doc tests but raise an exception as soon as there is a failure.

       If an unexpected exception occurs, an UnexpectedException is raised.
       It contains the test, the example, and the original exception:

         >>> runner = DebugRunner(verbose=False)
         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('>>> raise KeyError\n42',
         ...                                    {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)
         >>> try:
         ...     runner.run(test)
         ... except UnexpectedException as f:
         ...     failure = f

         >>> failure.test is test
         True

         >>> failure.example.want
         '42\n'

         >>> exc_info = failure.exc_info
         >>> raise exc_info[1] # Already has the traceback
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         KeyError

       We wrap the original exception to give the calling application
       access to the test and example information.

       If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
         ...      >>> x = 1
         ...      >>> x
         ...      2
         ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

         >>> try:
         ...    runner.run(test)
         ... except DocTestFailure as f:
         ...    failure = f

       DocTestFailure objects provide access to the test:

         >>> failure.test is test
         True

       As well as to the example:

         >>> failure.example.want
         '2\n'

       and the actual output:

         >>> failure.got
         '1\n'

       If a failure or error occurs, the globals are left intact:

         >>> del test.globs['__builtins__']
         >>> test.globs
         {'x': 1}

         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
         ...      >>> x = 2
         ...      >>> raise KeyError
         ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

         >>> runner.run(test)
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         doctest.UnexpectedException: <DocTest foo from foo.py:0 (2 examples)>

         >>> del test.globs['__builtins__']
         >>> test.globs
         {'x': 2}

       But the globals are cleared if there is no error:

         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
         ...      >>> x = 2
         ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

         >>> runner.run(test)

    Test examples in docstrings in functions and classes reachable
    from module m (or the current module if m is not supplied), starting
    with m.__doc__.

    Also test examples reachable from dict m.__test__ if it exists and is
    not None.  m.__test__ maps names to functions, classes and strings;
    function and class docstrings are tested even if the name is private;
    strings are tested directly, as if they were docstrings.

    Return (#failures, #tests).

    See help(doctest) for an overview.

    Optional keyword arg "name" gives the name of the module; by default
    use m.__name__.

    Optional keyword arg "globs" gives a dict to be used as the globals
    when executing examples; by default, use m.__dict__.  A copy of this
    dict is actually used for each docstring, so that each docstring's
    examples start with a clean slate.

    Optional keyword arg "extraglobs" gives a dictionary that should be
    merged into the globals that are used to execute examples.  By
    default, no extra globals are used.  This is new in 2.4.

    Optional keyword arg "verbose" prints lots of stuff if true, prints
    only failures if false; by default, it's true iff "-v" is in sys.argv.

    Optional keyword arg "report" prints a summary at the end when true,
    else prints nothing at the end.  In verbose mode, the summary is
    detailed, else very brief (in fact, empty if all tests passed).

    Optional keyword arg "optionflags" or's together module constants,
    and defaults to 0.  This is new in 2.3.  Possible values (see the
    docs for details):

        REPORT_NDIFF
        REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE

    Optional keyword arg "raise_on_error" raises an exception on the
    first unexpected exception or failure. This allows failures to be
    post-mortem debugged.

    Advanced tomfoolery:  testmod runs methods of a local instance of
    class doctest.Tester, then merges the results into (or creates)
    global Tester instance doctest.master.  Methods of doctest.master
    can be called directly too, if you want to do something unusual.
    Passing report=0 to testmod is especially useful then, to delay
    displaying a summary.  Invoke doctest.master.summarize(verbose)
    when you're done fiddling.
    testmod: module required; %r
    Test examples in the given file.  Return (#failures, #tests).

    Optional keyword arg "module_relative" specifies how filenames
    should be interpreted:

      - If "module_relative" is True (the default), then "filename"
         specifies a module-relative path.  By default, this path is
         relative to the calling module's directory; but if the
         "package" argument is specified, then it is relative to that
         package.  To ensure os-independence, "filename" should use
         "/" characters to separate path segments, and should not
         be an absolute path (i.e., it may not begin with "/").

      - If "module_relative" is False, then "filename" specifies an
        os-specific path.  The path may be absolute or relative (to
        the current working directory).

    Optional keyword arg "name" gives the name of the test; by default
    use the file's basename.

    Optional keyword argument "package" is a Python package or the
    name of a Python package whose directory should be used as the
    base directory for a module relative filename.  If no package is
    specified, then the calling module's directory is used as the base
    directory for module relative filenames.  It is an error to
    specify "package" if "module_relative" is False.

    Optional keyword arg "globs" gives a dict to be used as the globals
    when executing examples; by default, use {}.  A copy of this dict
    is actually used for each docstring, so that each docstring's
    examples start with a clean slate.

    Optional keyword arg "extraglobs" gives a dictionary that should be
    merged into the globals that are used to execute examples.  By
    default, no extra globals are used.

    Optional keyword arg "verbose" prints lots of stuff if true, prints
    only failures if false; by default, it's true iff "-v" is in sys.argv.

    Optional keyword arg "report" prints a summary at the end when true,
    else prints nothing at the end.  In verbose mode, the summary is
    detailed, else very brief (in fact, empty if all tests passed).

    Optional keyword arg "optionflags" or's together module constants,
    and defaults to 0.  Possible values (see the docs for details):

        REPORT_CDIFF
        REPORT_NDIFF
        REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE

    Optional keyword arg "raise_on_error" raises an exception on the
    first unexpected exception or failure. This allows failures to be
    post-mortem debugged.

    Optional keyword arg "parser" specifies a DocTestParser (or
    subclass) that should be used to extract tests from the files.

    Optional keyword arg "encoding" specifies an encoding that should
    be used to convert the file to unicode.

    Advanced tomfoolery:  testmod runs methods of a local instance of
    class doctest.Tester, then merges the results into (or creates)
    global Tester instance doctest.master.  Methods of doctest.master
    can be called directly too, if you want to do something unusual.
    Passing report=0 to testmod is especially useful then, to delay

    Test examples in the given object's docstring (`f`), using `globs`
    as globals.  Optional argument `name` is used in failure messages.
    If the optional argument `verbose` is true, then generate output
    even if there are no failures.

    `compileflags` gives the set of flags that should be used by the
    Python compiler when running the examples.  If not specified, then
    it will default to the set of future-import flags that apply to
    `globs`.

    Optional keyword arg `optionflags` specifies options for the
    testing and output.  See the documentation for `testmod` for more
    information.
    _unittest_reportflagsSets the unittest option flags.

    The old flag is returned so that a runner could restore the old
    value if it wished to:

      >>> import doctest
      >>> old = doctest._unittest_reportflags
      >>> doctest.set_unittest_reportflags(REPORT_NDIFF |

           The unit test framework includes a debug method on test cases
           and test suites to support post-mortem debugging.  The test code
           is run in such a way that errors are not caught.  This way a
           caller can catch the errors and initiate post-mortem debugging.

           The DocTestCase provides a debug method that raises
           UnexpectedException errors if there is an unexpected
           exception:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('>>> raise KeyError\n42',
             ...                {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

             ...     failure = f

           The UnexpectedException contains the test, the example, and
           the original exception:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

             >>> failure.example.want
             '42\n'

             >>> exc_info = failure.exc_info
             >>> raise exc_info[1] # Already has the traceback
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             KeyError

           If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
             ...      >>> x = 1
             ...      >>> x
             ...      2
             ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)
             >>> case = DocTestCase(test)

             >>> try:
             ...    case.debug()
             ... except DocTestFailure as f:
             ...    failure = f

           DocTestFailure objects provide access to the test:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

           As well as to the example:

             >>> failure.example.want
             '2\n'

           and the actual output:

             >>> failure.got
             '1\n'

    Convert doctest tests for a module to a unittest test suite.

    This converts each documentation string in a module that
    contains doctest tests to a unittest test case.  If any of the
    tests in a doc string fail, then the test case fails.  An exception
    is raised showing the name of the file containing the test and a
    (sometimes approximate) line number.

    The `module` argument provides the module to be tested.  The argument
    can be either a module or a module name.

    If no argument is given, the calling module is used.

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    globs
      A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

    optionflags
       A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.
    DocFileCaseFailed doctest test for %s
  File "%s", line 0

%sDocFileTestA unittest suite for one or more doctest files.

    The path to each doctest file is given as a string; the
    interpretation of that string depends on the keyword argument
    "module_relative".

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    module_relative
      If "module_relative" is True, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-independent module-relative paths.  By
      default, these paths are relative to the calling module's
      directory; but if the "package" argument is specified, then
      they are relative to that package.  To ensure os-independence,
      "filename" should use "/" characters to separate path
      segments, and may not be an absolute path (i.e., it may not
      begin with "/").

      If "module_relative" is False, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-specific paths.  These paths may be absolute
      or relative (to the current working directory).

    package
      A Python package or the name of a Python package whose directory
      should be used as the base directory for module relative paths.
      If "package" is not specified, then the calling module's
      directory is used as the base directory for module relative
      filenames.  It is an error to specify "package" if
      "module_relative" is False.

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    globs
      A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

    optionflags
      A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.

    parser
      A DocTestParser (or subclass) that should be used to extract
      tests from the files.

    encoding
      An encoding that will be used to convert the files to unicode.
    Extract script from text with examples.

       Converts text with examples to a Python script.  Example input is
       converted to regular code.  Example output and all other words

Example & DocTest## - An "example" is a <source, want> pair, where "source" is a##   fragment of source code, and "want" is the expected output for##   "source."  The Example class also includes information about##   where the example was extracted from.## - A "doctest" is a collection of examples, typically extracted from##   a string (such as an object's docstring).  The DocTest class also##   includes information about where the string was extracted from.# Normalize inputs.# Store properties.# This lets us sort tests by name:## 3. DocTestParser# This regular expression is used to find doctest examples in a# string.  It defines three groups: `source` is the source code# (including leading indentation and prompts); `indent` is the# indentation of the first (PS1) line of the source code; and# `want` is the expected output (including leading indentation).# A regular expression for handling `want` strings that contain# expected exceptions.  It divides `want` into three pieces:#    - the traceback header line (`hdr`)#    - the traceback stack (`stack`)#    - the exception message (`msg`), as generated by#      traceback.format_exception_only()# `msg` may have multiple lines.  We assume/require that the# exception message is the first non-indented line starting with a word# character following the traceback header line.# A callable returning a true value iff its argument is a blank line# or contains a single comment.# If all lines begin with the same indentation, then strip it.# Find all doctest examples in the string:# Add the pre-example text to `output`.# Update lineno (lines before this example)# Extract info from the regexp match.# Create an Example, and add it to the list.# Update lineno (lines inside this example)# Update charno.# Add any remaining post-example text to `output`.# Get the example's indentation level.# Divide source into lines; check that they're properly# indented; and then strip their indentation & prompts.# Divide want into lines; check that it's properly indented; and# then strip the indentation.  Spaces before the last newline should# be preserved, so plain rstrip() isn't good enough.# forget final newline & spaces after it# If `want` contains a traceback message, then extract it.# Extract options from the source.# This regular expression looks for option directives in the# source code of an example.  Option directives are comments# starting with "doctest:".  Warning: this may give false# positives for string-literals that contain the string# "#doctest:".  Eliminating these false positives would require# actually parsing the string; but we limit them by ignoring any# line containing "#doctest:" that is *followed* by a quote mark.# (note: with the current regexp, this will match at most once:)# This regular expression finds the indentation of every non-blank# line in a string.## 4.

Test Functions# These should be backwards compatible.# For backward compatibility, a global instance of a DocTestRunner# class, updated by testmod.# If no module was given, then use __main__.# DWA - m will still be None if this wasn't invoked from the command# line, in which case the following TypeError is about as good an error# as we should expect# Check that we were actually given a module.# If no name was given, then use the module's name.# Find, parse, and run all tests in the given module.# Relativize the path# If no name was given, then use the file's name.# Assemble the globals.# Read the file, convert it to a test, and run it.## 7. Unittest Support# The option flags don't include any reporting flags,# so add the default reporting flags# Skip doctests when running with -O2# Relativize the path.# Find the file and read it.# Convert it to a test, and wrap it in a DocFileCase.# We do this here so that _normalize_module is called at the right# level.  If it were called in DocFileTest, then this function# would be the caller and we might guess the package incorrectly.## 8. Debugging Support# Add the example's source code (strip trailing NL)# Add the expected output:# Add non-example text.# Trim junk on both ends.# Combine the output, and return it.# Add a courtesy newline to prevent exec from choking (see bug #1172785)## 9. Example Usage# Verbose used to be handled by the "inspect argv" magic in DocTestRunner,# but since we are using argparse we are passing it manually now.# It is a module -- insert its dir into sys.path and try to# import it. If it is part of a package, that possibly# won't work because of package imports.b'Module doctest -- a framework for running examples in docstrings.

In simplest use, end each module M to be tested with:

def _test():
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()

Then running the module as a script will cause the examples in the
docstrings to get executed and verified:

python M.py

This won't display anything unless an example fails, in which case the
failing example(s) and the cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout
(why not stderr? because stderr is a lame hack <0.2 wink>), and the final
line of output is "Test failed.".

Run it with the -v switch instead:

python M.py -v

and a detailed report of all examples tried is printed to stdout, along
with assorted summaries at the end.

You can force verbose mode by passing "verbose=True" to testmod, or prohibit
it by passing "verbose=False".  In either of those cases, sys.argv is not
examined by testmod.

There are a variety of other ways to run doctests, including integration
with the unittest framework, and support for running non-Python text
files containing doctests.  There are also many ways to override parts
of doctest's default behaviors.  See the Library Reference Manual for
details.

    A single doctest example, consisting of source code and expected
    output.  `Example` defines the following attributes:

      - source: A single Python statement, always ending with a newline.
        The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - want: The expected output from running the source code (either
        from stdout, or a traceback in case of exception).  `want` ends
        with a newline unless it's empty, in which case it's an empty
        string.  The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - exc_msg: The exception message generated by the example, if
        the example is expected to generate an exception; or `None` if
        it is not expected to generate an exception.  This exception
        message is compared against the return value of
        `traceback.format_exception_only()`.  `exc_msg` ends with a
        newline unless it's `None`.  The constructor adds a newline
        if needed.

      - lineno: The line number within the DocTest string containing
        this Example where the Example begins.  This line number is
        zero-based, with respect to the beginning of the DocTest.

      - indent: The example's indentation in the DocTest string.
        I.e., the number of space characters that precede the
        example's first prompt.

      - options: A dictionary mapping from option flags to True or
        False, which is used to override default options for this
        example.  Any option flags not contained in this dictionary
        are left at their default value (as specified by the
        DocTestRunner's optionflags).  By default, no options are set.

        with a newline unless it's empty, in which case it's an empty
        string.  The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - exc_msg: The exception message generated by the example, if
        the example is expected to generate an exception; or `None` if
        it is not expected to generate an exception.  This exception
        message is compared against the return value of
        `traceback.format_exception_only()`.  `exc_msg` ends with a
        newline unless it's `None`.  The constructor adds a newline

        this Example where the Example begins.  This line number is
        zero-based, with respect to the beginning of the DocTest.

      - indent: The example's indentation in the DocTest string.
        I.e., the number of space characters that precede the
        example's first prompt.

      - options: A dictionary mapping from option flags to True or

    'b'
    A collection of doctest examples that should be run in a single
    namespace.  Each `DocTest` defines the following attributes:

        be run in.

      - name: A name identifying the DocTest (typically, the name of
        the object whose docstring this DocTest was extracted from).

      - filename: The name of the file that this DocTest was extracted
        from, or `None` if the filename is unknown.

      - lineno: The line number within filename where this DocTest
        begins, or `None` if the line number is unavailable.  This
        line number is zero-based, with respect to the beginning of
        the file.

        only examine the given object, and not any contained objects.

        If the optional argument `exclude_empty` is false, then `find`
        will include tests for objects with empty docstrings.
        'b'
        Return a list of the DocTests that are defined by the given
        object's docstring, or by any of its contained objects'
        docstrings.

        The optional parameter `module` is the module that contains
        the given object.  If the module is not specified or is None, then
        the test finder will attempt to automatically determine the
        correct module.  The object's module is used:

            - As a default namespace, if `globs` is not specified.
            - To prevent the DocTestFinder from extracting DocTests
              from objects that are imported from other modules.
            - To find the name of the file containing the object.
            - To help find the line number of the object within its
              file.

        Contained objects whose module does not match `module` are ignored.

        If `module` is False, no attempt to find the module will be made.
        This is obscure, of use mostly in tests:  if `module` is False, or
        is None but cannot be found automatically, then all objects are
        considered to belong to the (non-existent) module, so all contained
        objects will (recursively) be searched for doctests.

        The globals for each DocTest is formed by combining `globs`
        and `extraglobs` (bindings in `extraglobs` override bindings
        in `globs`).  A new copy of the globals dictionary is created
        for each DocTest.  If `globs` is not specified, then it
        defaults to the module's `__dict__`, if specified, or {}
        otherwise.  If `extraglobs` is not specified, then it defaults
        to {}.

        'u'
        Return a list of the DocTests that are defined by the given
        object's docstring, or by any of its contained objects'
        docstrings.

    A class used to run DocTest test cases, and accumulate statistics.
    The `run` method is used to process a single DocTest case.  It
    returns a tuple `(f, t)`, where `t` is the number of test cases
    tried, and `f` is the number of test cases that failed.

        >>> tests = DocTestFinder().find(_TestClass)
        >>> runner = DocTestRunner(verbose=False)
        >>> tests.sort(key = lambda test: test.name)
        >>> for test in tests:

        _TestClass.get -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.square -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=1)

    The `summarize` method prints a summary of all the test cases that
    have been run by the runner, and returns an aggregated `(f, t)`
    tuple:

        >>> runner.summarize(verbose=1)
        4 items passed all tests:
           2 tests in _TestClass
           2 tests in _TestClass.__init__
           2 tests in _TestClass.get
           1 tests in _TestClass.square
        7 tests in 4 items.
        7 passed and 0 failed.
        Test passed.
        TestResults(failed=0, attempted=7)

    The aggregated number of tried examples and failed examples is
    also available via the `tries` and `failures` attributes:

        >>> runner.tries
        7
        >>> runner.failures
        0

    The comparison between expected outputs and actual outputs is done
    by an `OutputChecker`.  This comparison may be customized with a
    number of option flags; see the documentation for `testmod` for
    more information.  If the option flags are insufficient, then the
    comparison may also be customized by passing a subclass of
    `OutputChecker` to the constructor.

    The test runner's display output can be controlled in two ways.
    First, an output function (`out) can be passed to
    `TestRunner.run`; this function will be called with strings that
    should be displayed.  It defaults to `sys.stdout.write`.  If
    capturing the output is not sufficient, then the display output
    can be also customized by subclassing DocTestRunner, and
    overriding the methods `report_start`, `report_success`,
    `report_unexpected_exception`, and `report_failure`.

           The unit test framework includes a debug method on test cases
           and test suites to support post-mortem debugging.  The test code
           is run in such a way that errors are not caught.  This way a
           caller can catch the errors and initiate post-mortem debugging.

           The DocTestCase provides a debug method that raises
           UnexpectedException errors if there is an unexpected
           exception:

             ...     failure = f

           The UnexpectedException contains the test, the example, and
           the original exception:

             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             KeyError

           If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
             ...      >>> x = 1

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('>>> raise KeyError\n42',
             ...                {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

             ...     failure = f

           The UnexpectedException contains the test, the example, and
           the original exception:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

             >>> failure.example.want
             '42\n'

             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             KeyError

           If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
             ...      >>> x = 1
             ...      >>> x

             ...    case.debug()
             ... except DocTestFailure as f:
             ...    failure = f

           DocTestFailure objects provide access to the test:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

           As well as to the example:

             >>> failure.example.want
             '2\n'

           and the actual output:

    Convert doctest tests for a module to a unittest test suite.

    This converts each documentation string in a module that
    contains doctest tests to a unittest test case.  If any of the
    tests in a doc string fail, then the test case fails.  An exception
    is raised showing the name of the file containing the test and a
    (sometimes approximate) line number.

    The `module` argument provides the module to be tested.  The argument
    can be either a module or a module name.

    If no argument is given, the calling module is used.

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest

%s'b'A unittest suite for one or more doctest files.

    The path to each doctest file is given as a string; the
    interpretation of that string depends on the keyword argument
    "module_relative".

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    module_relative
      If "module_relative" is True, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-independent module-relative paths.  By
      default, these paths are relative to the calling module's
      directory; but if the "package" argument is specified, then
      they are relative to that package.  To ensure os-independence,
      "filename" should use "/" characters to separate path
      segments, and may not be an absolute path (i.e., it may not
      begin with "/").

      If "module_relative" is False, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-specific paths.  These paths may be absolute
      or relative (to the current working directory).

    package
      A Python package or the name of a Python package whose directory
      should be used as the base directory for module relative paths.
      If "package" is not specified, then the calling module's
      directory is used as the base directory for module relative
      filenames.  It is an error to specify "package" if
      "module_relative" is False.

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    To extend this to recognize other objects, subclass and implement a
    ``.default()`` method with another method that returns a serializable
    object for ``o`` if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass
    implementation (to raise ``TypeError``).

    Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.

        If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
        encoding of keys that are not str, int, float or None.  If
        skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.

        If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
        objects with all incoming non-ASCII characters escaped.  If
        ensure_ascii is false, the output can contain non-ASCII characters.

        If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
        objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
        prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
        Otherwise, no such check takes place.

        If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
        encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
        but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
        Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.

        If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
        sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
        that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.

        If indent is a non-negative integer, then JSON array
        elements and object members will be pretty-printed with that
        indent level.  An indent level of 0 will only insert newlines.
        None is the most compact representation.

        If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
        tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
        (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
        you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.

        If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
        that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
        version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.

        Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
        a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
        (to raise a ``TypeError``).

        For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
        implement default like this::

            def default(self, o):
                try:
                    iterable = iter(o)
                except TypeError:
                    pass
                else:
                    return list(iterable)
                # Let the base class default method raise the TypeError
                return JSONEncoder.default(self, o)

        qualname
        Either returns an existing member, or creates a new enum class.

        This method is used both when an enum class is given a value to match
        to an enumeration member (i.e. Color(3)) and for the functional API
        (i.e. Color = Enum('Color', names='RED GREEN BLUE')).

        When used for the functional API:

        `value` will be the name of the new class.

        `names` should be either a string of white-space/comma delimited names
        (values will start at `start`), or an iterator/mapping of name, value pairs.

        `module` should be set to the module this class is being created in;
        if it is not set, an attempt to find that module will be made, but if
        it fails the class will not be picklable.

        `qualname` should be set to the actual location this class can be found
        at in its module; by default it is set to the global scope.  If this is
        not correct, unpickling will fail in some circumstances.

        `type`, if set, will be mixed in as the first base class.
        _create_unsupported operand type(s) for 'in': '%s' and '%s'%s: cannot delete Enum member.
        Return the enum member matching `name`

        We use __getattr__ instead of descriptors or inserting into the enum
        class' __dict__ in order to support `name` and `value` being both
        properties for enum members (which live in the class' __dict__) and
        enum members themselves.
        
        Returns members in definition order.
        
        Returns a mapping of member name->value.

        This mapping lists all enum members, including aliases. Note that this
        is a read-only view of the internal mapping.
        <enum %r>
        Returns members in reverse definition order.
        
        Block attempts to reassign Enum members.

        A simple assignment to the class namespace only changes one of the
        several possible ways to get an Enum member from the Enum class,
        resulting in an inconsistent Enumeration.
        member_mapCannot reassign members.
        Convenience method to create a new Enum class.

        `names` can be:

        * A string containing member names, separated either with spaces or
          commas.  Values are incremented by 1 from `start`.
        * An iterable of member names.  Values are incremented by 1 from `start`.
        * An iterable of (member name, value) pairs.
        * A mapping of member name -> value pairs.

        Either returns an existing member, or creates a new enum class.

        This method is used both when an enum class is given a value to match
        to an enumeration member (i.e. Color(3)) and for the functional API
        (i.e. Color = Enum('Color', names='RED GREEN BLUE')).

        When used for the functional API:

        `value` will be the name of the new class.

        `names` should be either a string of white-space/comma delimited names
        (values will start at `start`), or an iterator/mapping of name, value pairs.

        `module` should be set to the module this class is being created in;
        if it is not set, an attempt to find that module will be made, but if
        it fails the class will not be picklable.

        `qualname` should be set to the actual location this class can be found
        at in its module; by default it is set to the global scope.  If this is
        not correct, unpickling will fail in some circumstances.

        `type`, if set, will be mixed in as the first base class.

The value of each symbol is the corresponding integer value,
e.g., on most systems, errno.ENOENT equals the integer 2.

The dictionary errno.errorcode maps numeric codes to symbol names,
e.g., errno.errorcode[2] could be the string 'ENOENT'.

Symbols that are not relevant to the underlying system are not defined.

To map error codes to error messages, use the function os.strerror(),
e.g. os.strerror(2) could return 'No such file or directory'.'errorcodeException classes raised by urllib.

        A coroutine which creates a TCP server bound to host and port.

        The return value is a Server object which can be used to stop
        the service.

        If host is an empty string or None all interfaces are assumed
        and a list of multiple sockets will be returned (most likely
        one for IPv4 and another one for IPv6). The host parameter can also be
        a sequence (e.g. list) of hosts to bind to.

        family can be set to either AF_INET or AF_INET6 to force the
        socket to use IPv4 or IPv6. If not set it will be determined
        from host (defaults to AF_UNSPEC).

        flags is a bitmask for getaddrinfo().

        sock can optionally be specified in order to use a preexisting
        socket object.

        backlog is the maximum number of queued connections passed to
        listen() (defaults to 100).

        ssl can be set to an SSLContext to enable SSL over the
        accepted connections.

        reuse_address tells the kernel to reuse a local socket in
        TIME_WAIT state, without waiting for its natural timeout to
        expire. If not specified will automatically be set to True on
        UNIX.

        reuse_port tells the kernel to allow this endpoint to be bound to
        the same port as other existing endpoints are bound to, so long as
        they all set this flag when being created. This option is not
        supported on Windows.

        ssl_handshake_timeout is the time in seconds that an SSL server
        will wait for completion of the SSL handshake before aborting the
        connection. Default is 60s.

        start_serving set to True (default) causes the created server
        to start accepting connections immediately.  When set to False,
        the user should await Server.start_serving() or Server.serve_forever()
        to make the server to start accepting connections.

        path is a str, representing a file systsem path to bind the
        server socket to.

        sock can optionally be specified in order to use a preexisting
        socket object.

        A coroutine which creates a datagram endpoint.

        This method will try to establish the endpoint in the background.
        When successful, the coroutine returns a (transport, protocol) pair.

        protocol_factory must be a callable returning a protocol instance.

        socket family AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6 or socket.AF_UNIX depending on
        host (or family if specified), socket type SOCK_DGRAM.

        reuse_address tells the kernel to reuse a local socket in
        TIME_WAIT state, without waiting for its natural timeout to
        expire. If not specified it will automatically be set to True on
        UNIX.

        reuse_port tells the kernel to allow this endpoint to be bound to
        the same port as other existing endpoints are bound to, so long as
        they all set this flag when being created. This option is not
        supported on Windows and some UNIX's. If the
        :py:data:`~socket.SO_REUSEPORT` constant is not defined then this
        capability is unsupported.

        allow_broadcast tells the kernel to allow this endpoint to send
        messages to the broadcast address.

        sock can optionally be specified in order to use a preexisting
        socket object.

The feed parser implements an interface for incrementally parsing an email
message, line by line.  This has advantages for certain applications, such as
those reading email messages off a socket.

FeedParser.feed() is the primary interface for pushing new data into the
parser.  It returns when there's nothing more it can do with the available
data.  When you have no more data to push into the parser, call .close().
This completes the parsing and returns the root message object.

The other advantage of this parser is that it will never raise a parsing
exception.  Instead, when it finds something unexpected, it adds a 'defect' to
the current message.  Defects are just instances that live on the message
object's .defects attribute.

    You can also push and pop line-matching predicates onto a stack.  When the
    current predicate matches the current line, a false EOF response
    (i.e. empty string) is returned instead.  This lets the parser adhere to a
    simple abstraction -- it parses until EOF closes the current message.

exception.  Instead, when it finds something unexpected, it adds a 'defect' to
the current message.  Defects are just instances that live on the message
object's .defects attribute.
'u'FeedParser - An email feed parser.

The feed parser implements an interface for incrementally parsing an email
message, line by line.  This has advantages for certain applications, such as
those reading email messages off a socket.

FeedParser.feed() is the primary interface for pushing new data into the
parser.  It returns when there's nothing more it can do with the available
data.  When you have no more data to push into the parser, call .close().
This completes the parsing and returns the root message object.

exception.  Instead, when it finds something unexpected, it adds a 'defect' to
the current message.  Defects are just instances that live on the message

    You can also push and pop line-matching predicates onto a stack.  When the

    (i.e. empty string) is returned instead.  This lets the parser adhere to a
    simple abstraction -- it parses until EOF closes the current message.

A nice test that reveals some of the network dialogue would be:
python ftplib.py -d localhost -l -p -l
FTPerror_replyerror_temperror_permerror_protoall_errorsFTP_PORTMAXLINEB_CRLFAn FTP client class.

    To create a connection, call the class using these arguments:
            host, user, passwd, acct, timeout

    The first four arguments are all strings, and have default value ''.
    timeout must be numeric and defaults to None if not passed,
    meaning that no timeout will be set on any ftp socket(s)
    If a timeout is passed, then this is now the default timeout for all ftp
    socket operations for this instance.

    Then use self.connect() with optional host and port argument.

    To download a file, use ftp.retrlines('RETR ' + filename),
    or ftp.retrbinary() with slightly different arguments.
    To upload a file, use ftp.storlines() or ftp.storbinary(),
    which have an open file as argument (see their definitions
    below for details).
    The download/upload functions first issue appropriate TYPE
    and PORT or PASV commands.
    debuggingmaxlinewelcomepassiveservertrust_server_pasv_ipv4_addresspasswdacctloginquitConnect to host.  Arguments are:
         - host: hostname to connect to (string, default previous host)
         - port: port to connect to (integer, default previous port)
         - timeout: the timeout to set against the ftp socket(s)
         - source_address: a 2-tuple (host, port) for the socket to bind
           to as its source address before connecting.
        ftplib.connectgetrespgetwelcomeGet the welcome message from the server.
        (this is read and squirreled away by connect())*welcome*Set the debugging level.
        The required argument level means:
        0: no debugging output (default)
        1: print commands and responses but not body text etc.
        2: also print raw lines read and sent before stripping CR/LFset_pasvUse passive or active mode for data transfers.

        This does not follow the procedure from the RFC to send Telnet

        If the transfer is active, send a port command and the
        transfer command, and accept the connection.  If the server is
        passive, send a pasv command, connect to it, and start the
        transfer command.  Either way, return the socket for the
        connection and the expected size of the transfer.  The
        expected size may be None if it could not be determined.

        Optional `rest' argument can be a string that is sent as the
        argument to a REST command.  This is essentially a server
        marker used to tell the server to skip over any data up to the
        given marker.

    Apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence,

    For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates

        per element.  This is important because the lru_cache() will hash
        the key multiple times on a cache miss.

    hashvalue_make_keykwd_markfasttypesMake a cache key from optionally typed positional and keyword arguments

    The key is constructed in a way that is flat as possible rather than
    as a nested structure that would take more memory.

    If there is only a single argument and its data type is known to cache
    its hash value, then that argument is returned without a wrapper.  This
    saves space and improves lookup speed.

    Least-recently-used cache decorator.

    If *maxsize* is set to None, the LRU features are disabled and the cache
    can grow without bound.

    If *typed* is True, arguments of different types will be cached separately.
    For example, f(3.0) and f(3) will be treated as distinct calls with
    distinct results.

    Arguments to the cached function must be hashable.

    View the cache statistics named tuple (hits, misses, maxsize, currsize)
    with f.cache_info().  Clear the cache and statistics with f.cache_clear().
    Access the underlying function with f.__wrapped__.

    Adapted from http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/.

    Inconsistent hierarchy_c3_mroabcsComputes the method resolution order using extended C3 linearization.

    If no *abcs* are given, the algorithm works exactly like the built-in C3
    linearization used for method resolution.

    If given, *abcs* is a list of abstract base classes that should be inserted
    into the resulting MRO. Unrelated ABCs are ignored and don't end up in the
    result. The algorithm inserts ABCs where their functionality is introduced,
    i.e. issubclass(cls, abc) returns True for the class itself but returns
    False for all its direct base classes. Implicit ABCs for a given class
    (either registered or inferred from the presence of a special method like
    __len__) are inserted directly after the last ABC explicitly listed in the
    MRO of said class. If two implicit ABCs end up next to each other in the
    resulting MRO, their ordering depends on the order of types in *abcs*.

    explicit_basesabstract_basesother_basesexplicit_c3_mrosabstract_c3_mrosother_c3_mros_compose_mroCalculates the method resolution order for a given class *cls*.

    Includes relevant abstract base classes (with their respective bases) from
    the *types* iterable. Uses a modified C3 linearization algorithm.

    is_relatedis_strict_basetype_setsubcls_find_implReturns the best matching implementation from *registry* for type *cls*.

    Where there is no registered implementation for a specific type, its method
    resolution order is used to find a more generic implementation.

    Note: if *registry* does not contain an implementation for the base
    *object* type, this function may return None.

    Ambiguous dispatch: {} or {}Single-dispatch generic function decorator.

    Transforms a function into a generic function, which can have different
    behaviours depending upon the type of its first argument. The decorated
    function acts as the default implementation, and additional
    implementations can be registered using the register() attribute of the
    generic function.
    WeakKeyDictionarydispatch_cachecache_tokengeneric_func.dispatch(cls) -> <function implementation>

        Runs the dispatch algorithm to return the best available implementation

    This basic generator writes the message to the given file object as plain
    text.
    outfpmaxheaderlenCreate the generator for message flattening.

        outfp is the output file-like object for writing the message to.  It
        must have a write() method.

        Optional mangle_from_ is a flag that, when True (the default if policy
        is not set), escapes From_ lines in the body of the message by putting
        a `>' in front of them.

        Optional maxheaderlen specifies the longest length for a non-continued
        header.  When a header line is longer (in characters, with tabs
        expanded to 8 spaces) than maxheaderlen, the header will split as
        defined in the Header class.  Set maxheaderlen to zero to disable
        header wrapping.  The default is 78, as recommended (but not required)
        by RFC 2822.

        The policy keyword specifies a policy object that controls a number of
        aspects of the generator's operation.  If no policy is specified,
        the policy associated with the Message object passed to the
        flatten method is used.

        _mangle_from_flattenunixfromPrint the message object tree rooted at msg to the output file
        specified when the Generator instance was created.

        unixfrom is a flag that forces the printing of a Unix From_ delimiter
        before the first object in the message tree.  If the original message
        has no From_ delimiter, a `standard' one is crafted.  By default, this
        is False to inhibit the printing of any From_ delimiter.

        Note that for subobjects, no From_ line is printed.

        linesep specifies the characters used to indicate a new line in
        the output.  The default value is determined by the policy specified
        when the Generator instance was created or, if none was specified,
        from the policy associated with the msg.

    Functionally identical to the base Generator except that the output is
    bytes and not string.  When surrogates were used in the input to encode
    bytes, these are decoded back to bytes for output.  If the policy has
    cte_type set to 7bit, then the message is transformed such that the
    non-ASCII bytes are properly content transfer encoded, using the charset
    unknown-8bit.

    The outfp object must accept bytes in its write method.
    [Non-text (%(type)s) part of message omitted, filename %(filename)s]_FMTGenerates a text representation of a message.

    Like the Generator base class, except that non-text parts are substituted
    with a format string representing the part.
    Like Generator.__init__() except that an additional optional
        argument is allowed.

        Walks through all subparts of a message.  If the subpart is of main
        type `text', then it prints the decoded payload of the subpart.

        Otherwise, fmt is a format string that is used instead of the message

This module helps scripts to parse the command line arguments in
sys.argv.  It supports the same conventions as the Unix getopt()
function (including the special meanings of arguments of the form `-'
and `--').  Long options similar to those supported by GNU software
may be used as well via an optional third argument.  This module
provides two functions and an exception:

getopt() -- Parse command line options
gnu_getopt() -- Like getopt(), but allow option and non-option arguments
to be intermixed.
GetoptError -- exception (class) raised with 'opt' attribute, which is the
option involved with the exception.
GetoptErrorgnu_getoptshortoptslongoptsgetopt(args, options[, long_options]) -> opts, args

    Parses command line options and parameter list.  args is the
    argument list to be parsed, without the leading reference to the
    running program.  Typically, this means "sys.argv[1:]".  shortopts
    is the string of option letters that the script wants to
    recognize, with options that require an argument followed by a
    colon (i.e., the same format that Unix getopt() uses).  If
    specified, longopts is a list of strings with the names of the
    long options which should be supported.  The leading '--'
    characters should not be included in the option name.  Options
    which require an argument should be followed by an equal sign
    ('=').

    The return value consists of two elements: the first is a list of
    (option, value) pairs; the second is the list of program arguments
    left after the option list was stripped (this is a trailing slice
    of the first argument).  Each option-and-value pair returned has
    the option as its first element, prefixed with a hyphen (e.g.,
    '-x'), and the option argument as its second element, or an empty
    string if the option has no argument.  The options occur in the
    list in the same order in which they were found, thus allowing
    multiple occurrences.  Long and short options may be mixed.

    do_longsdo_shortsgetopt(args, options[, long_options]) -> opts, args

    This function works like getopt(), except that GNU style scanning
    mode is used by default. This means that option and non-option
    arguments may be intermixed. The getopt() function stops
    processing options as soon as a non-option argument is
    encountered.

    If the first character of the option string is `+', or if the
    environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, then option
    processing stops as soon as a non-option argument is encountered.

'u'Parser for command line options.

This module helps scripts to parse the command line arguments in
sys.argv.  It supports the same conventions as the Unix getopt()
function (including the special meanings of arguments of the form `-'
and `--').  Long options similar to those supported by GNU software
may be used as well via an optional third argument.  This module
provides two functions and an exception:

getopt() -- Parse command line options
gnu_getopt() -- Like getopt(), but allow option and non-option arguments
to be intermixed.
GetoptError -- exception (class) raised with 'opt' attribute, which is the
option involved with the exception.
'b'GetoptError'u'GetoptError'b'getopt'u'getopt'b'gnu_getopt'u'gnu_getopt'b'getopt(args, options[, long_options]) -> opts, args

    Parses command line options and parameter list.  args is the
    argument list to be parsed, without the leading reference to the
    running program.  Typically, this means "sys.argv[1:]".  shortopts
    is the string of option letters that the script wants to
    recognize, with options that require an argument followed by a
    colon (i.e., the same format that Unix getopt() uses).  If
    specified, longopts is a list of strings with the names of the
    long options which should be supported.  The leading '--'
    characters should not be included in the option name.  Options
    which require an argument should be followed by an equal sign
    ('=').

    The return value consists of two elements: the first is a list of
    (option, value) pairs; the second is the list of program arguments
    left after the option list was stripped (this is a trailing slice
    of the first argument).  Each option-and-value pair returned has
    the option as its first element, prefixed with a hyphen (e.g.,
    '-x'), and the option argument as its second element, or an empty
    string if the option has no argument.  The options occur in the
    list in the same order in which they were found, thus allowing
    multiple occurrences.  Long and short options may be mixed.

    'b'getopt(args, options[, long_options]) -> opts, args

    This function works like getopt(), except that GNU style scanning
    mode is used by default. This means that option and non-option
    arguments may be intermixed. The getopt() function stops
    processing options as soon as a non-option argument is
    encountered.

    If the first character of the option string is `+', or if the
    environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, then option
    processing stops as soon as a non-option argument is encountered.

    'b'[\1]'u'[\1]'This module defines the data structures used to represent a grammar.

These are a bit arcane because they are derived from the data
structures used by Python's 'pgen' parser generator.

There's also a table here mapping operators to their names in the
token module; the Python tokenize module reports all operators as the
fallback token code OP, but the parser needs the actual token code.

Pgen parsing tables conversion class.

    Once initialized, this class supplies the grammar tables for the
    parsing engine implemented by parse.py.  The parsing engine
    accesses the instance variables directly.  The class here does not
    provide initialization of the tables; several subclasses exist to
    do this (see the conv and pgen modules).

    The load() method reads the tables from a pickle file, which is
    much faster than the other ways offered by subclasses.  The pickle
    file is written by calling dump() (after loading the grammar
    tables using a subclass).  The report() method prints a readable
    representation of the tables to stdout, for debugging.

    The instance variables are as follows:

    symbol2number -- a dict mapping symbol names to numbers.  Symbol
                     numbers are always 256 or higher, to distinguish
                     them from token numbers, which are between 0 and
                     255 (inclusive).

    number2symbol -- a dict mapping numbers to symbol names;
                     these two are each other's inverse.

    states        -- a list of DFAs, where each DFA is a list of
                     states, each state is a list of arcs, and each
                     arc is a (i, j) pair where i is a label and j is
                     a state number.  The DFA number is the index into
                     this list.  (This name is slightly confusing.)
                     Final states are represented by a special arc of
                     the form (0, j) where j is its own state number.

    dfas          -- a dict mapping symbol numbers to (DFA, first)
                     pairs, where DFA is an item from the states list
                     above, and first is a set of tokens that can
                     begin this grammar rule (represented by a dict
                     whose values are always 1).

    labels        -- a list of (x, y) pairs where x is either a token
                     number or a symbol number, and y is either None
                     or a string; the strings are keywords.  The label
                     number is the index in this list; label numbers
                     are used to mark state transitions (arcs) in the
                     DFAs.

    start         -- the number of the grammar's start symbol.

    keywords      -- a dict mapping keyword strings to arc labels.

    tokens        -- a dict mapping token numbers to arc labels.

    The filename argument can be an actual filename (a str or bytes object), or
    an existing file object to read from or write to.

    The mode argument can be "r", "rb", "w", "wb", "x", "xb", "a" or "ab" for
    binary mode, or "rt", "wt", "xt" or "at" for text mode. The default mode is
    "rb", and the default compresslevel is 9.

    For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the GzipFile constructor:
    GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel). In this case, the encoding, errors
    and newline arguments must not be provided.

    For text mode, a GzipFile object is created, and wrapped in an

    behavior, and line ending(s).

    the exception of the truncate() method.

    This class only supports opening files in binary mode. If you need to open a

    myfileobjConstructor for the GzipFile class.

        At least one of fileobj and filename must be given a
        non-trivial value.

        The new class instance is based on fileobj, which can be a regular
        file, an io.BytesIO object, or any other object which simulates a file.
        It defaults to None, in which case filename is opened to provide
        a file object.

        When fileobj is not None, the filename argument is only used to be
        included in the gzip file header, which may include the original
        filename of the uncompressed file.  It defaults to the filename of
        fileobj, if discernible; otherwise, it defaults to the empty string,
        and in this case the original filename is not included in the header.

        The mode argument can be any of 'r', 'rb', 'a', 'ab', 'w', 'wb', 'x', or
        'xb' depending on whether the file will be read or written.  The default
        is the mode of fileobj if discernible; otherwise, the default is 'rb'.
        A mode of 'r' is equivalent to one of 'rb', and similarly for 'w' and
        'wb', 'a' and 'ab', and 'x' and 'xb'.

        The compresslevel argument is an integer from 0 to 9 controlling the
        level of compression; 1 is fastest and produces the least compression,
        and 9 is slowest and produces the most compression. 0 is no compression
        at all. The default is 9.

        The mtime argument is an optional numeric timestamp to be written
        to the last modification time field in the stream when compressing.
        If omitted or None, the current time is used.

        Modify the filename of a log file when rotating.

        This is provided so that a custom filename can be provided.

        The default implementation calls the 'namer' attribute of the
        handler, if it's callable, passing the default name to
        it. If the attribute isn't callable (the default is None), the name
        is returned unchanged.

        :param default_name: The default name for the log file.
        
        When rotating, rotate the current log.

        The default implementation calls the 'rotator' attribute of the
        handler, if it's callable, passing the source and dest arguments to
        it. If the attribute isn't callable (the default is None), the source
        is simply renamed to the destination.

        :param source: The source filename. This is normally the base
                       filename, e.g. 'test.log'
        :param dest:   The destination filename. This is normally
                       what the source is rotated to, e.g. 'test.log.1'.

        Open the specified file and use it as the stream for logging.

        By default, the file grows indefinitely. You can specify particular
        values of maxBytes and backupCount to allow the file to rollover at
        a predetermined size.

        Rollover occurs whenever the current log file is nearly maxBytes in
        length. If backupCount is >= 1, the system will successively create
        new files with the same pathname as the base file, but with extensions
        ".1", ".2" etc. appended to it. For example, with a backupCount of 5
        and a base file name of "app.log", you would get "app.log",
        "app.log.1", "app.log.2", ... through to "app.log.5". The file being
        written to is always "app.log" - when it gets filled up, it is closed
        and renamed to "app.log.1", and if files "app.log.1", "app.log.2" etc.
        exist, then they are renamed to "app.log.2", "app.log.3" etc.
        respectively.

        If maxBytes is zero, rollover never occurs.
        
        Do a rollover, as described in __init__().
        %s.%dsfndfn.1
        Determine if rollover should occur.

        Basically, see if the supplied record would cause the file to exceed
        the size limit we have.
        TimedRotatingFileHandler
    Handler for logging to a file, rotating the log file at certain timed
    intervals.

    If backupCount is > 0, when rollover is done, no more than backupCount
    files are kept - the oldest ones are deleted.

        Determine if rollover should occur.

        record is not used, as we are just comparing times, but it is needed so
        the method signatures are the same
        getFilesToDelete
        Determine the files to delete when rolling over.

        More specific than the earlier method, which just used glob.glob().
        dirNamebaseNamefileNamesplenfileName
        do a rollover; in this case, a date/time stamp is appended to the filename
        when the rollover happens.  However, you want the file to be named for the
        start of the interval, not the current time.  If there is a backup count,
        then we have to get a list of matching filenames, sort them and remove
        the one with the oldest suffix.
        timeTupledstThenWatchedFileHandler
    A handler for logging to a file, which watches the file
    to see if it has changed while in use. This can happen because of
    usage of programs such as newsyslog and logrotate which perform
    log file rotation. This handler, intended for use under Unix,
    watches the file to see if it has changed since the last emit.
    (A file has changed if its device or inode have changed.)
    If it has changed, the old file stream is closed, and the file
    opened to get a new stream.

    This handler is not appropriate for use under Windows, because
    under Windows open files cannot be moved or renamed - logging
    opens the files with exclusive locks - and so there is no need
    for such a handler. Furthermore, ST_INO is not supported under
    Windows; stat always returns zero for this value.

    This handler is based on a suggestion and patch by Chad J.
    Schroeder.
    ino_statstreamsresreopenIfNeeded
        Reopen log file if needed.

        Checks if the underlying file has changed, and if it
        has, close the old stream and reopen the file to get the
        current stream.
        
        Emit a record.

        If underlying file has changed, reopen the file before emitting the
        record to it.
        SocketHandler
    A handler class which writes logging records, in pickle format, to
    a streaming socket. The socket is kept open across logging calls.
    If the peer resets it, an attempt is made to reconnect on the next call.
    The pickle which is sent is that of the LogRecord's attribute dictionary
    (__dict__), so that the receiver does not need to have the logging module
    installed in order to process the logging event.

    To unpickle the record at the receiving end into a LogRecord, use the
    makeLogRecord function.
    
        Initializes the handler with a specific host address and port.

        When the attribute *closeOnError* is set to True - if a socket error
        occurs, the socket is silently closed and then reopened on the next
        logging call.
        closeOnErrorretryTimeretryStartretryMaxretryFactormakeSocket
        A factory method which allows subclasses to define the precise
        type of socket they want.
        createSocket
        Try to create a socket, using an exponential backoff with
        a max retry time. Thanks to Robert Olson for the original patch
        (SF #815911) which has been slightly refactored.
        attemptretryPeriod
        Send a pickled string to the socket.

        This function allows for partial sends which can happen when the
        network is busy.
        makePickle
        Pickles the record in binary format with a length prefix, and
        returns it ready for transmission across the socket.
        dummy>Lslen
        Handle an error during logging.

        An error has occurred during logging. Most likely cause -
        connection lost. Close the socket so that we can retry on the
        next event.
        
        Emit a record.

        Pickles the record and writes it to the socket in binary format.
        If there is an error with the socket, silently drop the packet.
        If there was a problem with the socket, re-establishes the
        socket.
        
        Closes the socket.
        DatagramHandler
    A handler class which writes logging records, in pickle format, to
    a datagram socket.  The pickle which is sent is that of the LogRecord's
    attribute dictionary (__dict__), so that the receiver does not need to
    have the logging module installed in order to process the logging event.

    To unpickle the record at the receiving end into a LogRecord, use the
    makeLogRecord function.

    
        Initializes the handler with a specific host address and port.
        
        The factory method of SocketHandler is here overridden to create
        a UDP socket (SOCK_DGRAM).
        
        Send a pickled string to a socket.

        This function no longer allows for partial sends which can happen
        when the network is busy - UDP does not guarantee delivery and
        can deliver packets out of sequence.
        SysLogHandler
    A handler class which sends formatted logging records to a syslog
    server. Based on Sam Rushing's syslog module:
    http://www.nightmare.com/squirl/python-ext/misc/syslog.py
    Contributed by Nicolas Untz (after which minor refactoring changes
    have been made).
    LOG_EMERGLOG_ALERTLOG_CRITLOG_ERRLOG_WARNINGLOG_NOTICELOG_INFOLOG_DEBUGLOG_KERNLOG_USERLOG_MAILLOG_DAEMONLOG_AUTHLOG_SYSLOGLOG_LPRLOG_NEWSLOG_UUCPLOG_CRONLOG_AUTHPRIVLOG_FTPLOG_LOCAL0LOG_LOCAL1LOG_LOCAL2LOG_LOCAL3LOG_LOCAL4LOG_LOCAL5LOG_LOCAL6LOG_LOCAL7alertcritemergnoticepanicpriority_namesauthprivcrondaemonkernlprmailnewssecuritysysloguucplocal0local1local2local3local4local5local6local7facility_namespriority_mapfacility
        Initialize a handler.

        If address is specified as a string, a UNIX socket is used. To log to a
        local syslogd, "SysLogHandler(address="/dev/log")" can be used.
        If facility is not specified, LOG_USER is used. If socktype is
        specified as socket.SOCK_DGRAM or socket.SOCK_STREAM, that specific
        socket type will be used. For Unix sockets, you can also specify a
        socktype of None, in which case socket.SOCK_DGRAM will be used, falling
        back to socket.SOCK_STREAM.
        unixsocket_connect_unixsocketressuse_socktypeencodePriority
        Encode the facility and priority. You can pass in strings or
        integers - if strings are passed, the facility_names and
        priority_names mapping dictionaries are used to convert them to
        integers.
        mapPriority
        Map a logging level name to a key in the priority_names map.
        This is useful in two scenarios: when custom levels are being
        used, and in the case where you can't do a straightforward
        mapping by lowercasing the logging level name because of locale-
        specific issues (see SF #1524081).
        identappend_nul
        Emit a record.

        The record is formatted, and then sent to the syslog server. If
        exception information is present, it is NOT sent to the server.
        <%d>prioSMTPHandler
    A handler class which sends an SMTP email for each logging event.
    5.0fromaddrtoaddrs
        Initialize the handler.

        Initialize the instance with the from and to addresses and subject
        line of the email. To specify a non-standard SMTP port, use the
        (host, port) tuple format for the mailhost argument. To specify
        authentication credentials, supply a (username, password) tuple
        for the credentials argument. To specify the use of a secure
        protocol (TLS), pass in a tuple for the secure argument. This will
        only be used when authentication credentials are supplied. The tuple
        will be either an empty tuple, or a single-value tuple with the name
        of a keyfile, or a 2-value tuple with the names of the keyfile and
        certificate file. (This tuple is passed to the `starttls` method).
        A timeout in seconds can be specified for the SMTP connection (the
        default is one second).
        getSubject
        Determine the subject for the email.

        If you want to specify a subject line which is record-dependent,
        override this method.
        
        Emit a record.

        Format the record and send it to the specified addressees.
        smtplibSMTP_PORTSMTPsmtpehlostarttlssend_messageNTEventLogHandler
    A handler class which sends events to the NT Event Log. Adds a
    registry entry for the specified application name. If no dllname is
    provided, win32service.pyd (which contains some basic message
    placeholders) is used. Note that use of these placeholders will make
    your event logs big, as the entire message source is held in the log.
    If you want slimmer logs, you have to pass in the name of your own DLL
    which contains the message definitions you want to use in the event log.

        Return the message ID for the event record. If you are using your
        own messages, you could do this by having the msg passed to the
        logger being an ID rather than a formatting string. Then, in here,
        you could use a dictionary lookup to get the message ID. This
        version returns 1, which is the base message ID in win32service.pyd.
        getEventCategory
        Return the event category for the record.

        Override this if you want to specify your own categories. This version
        returns 0.
        getEventType
        Return the event type for the record.

        Override this if you want to specify your own types. This version does
        a mapping using the handler's typemap attribute, which is set up in
        __init__() to a dictionary which contains mappings for DEBUG, INFO,
        WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL. If you are using your own levels you will
        either need to override this method or place a suitable dictionary in
        the handler's typemap attribute.
        
        Emit a record.

        Determine the message ID, event category and event type. Then
        log the message in the NT event log.
        ReportEvent
        Clean up this handler.

        You can remove the application name from the registry as a
        source of event log entries. However, if you do this, you will
        not be able to see the events as you intended in the Event Log
        Viewer - it needs to be able to access the registry to get the
        DLL name.
        HTTPHandler
    A class which sends records to a Web server, using either GET or
    POST semantics.
    
        Initialize the instance with the host, the request URL, and the method
        ("GET" or "POST")
        method must be GET or POSTcontext parameter only makes sense with secure=True"context parameter only makes sense ""with secure=True"mapLogRecord
        Default implementation of mapping the log record into a dict
        that is sent as the CGI data. Overwrite in your class.
        Contributed by Franz Glasner.
        
        Emit a record.

        Send the record to the Web server as a percent-encoded dictionary
        %c%sContent-typeContent-length
  A handler class which buffers logging records in memory. Whenever each
  record is added to the buffer, a check is made to see if the buffer should
  be flushed. If it should, then flush() is expected to do what's needed.
    capacity
        Initialize the handler with the buffer size.
        
        Should the handler flush its buffer?

        Returns true if the buffer is up to capacity. This method can be
        overridden to implement custom flushing strategies.
        
        Emit a record.

        Append the record. If shouldFlush() tells us to, call flush() to process
        the buffer.
        
        Override to implement custom flushing behaviour.

        This version just zaps the buffer to empty.
        
        Close the handler.

        This version just flushes and chains to the parent class' close().
        MemoryHandler
    A handler class which buffers logging records in memory, periodically
    flushing them to a target handler. Flushing occurs whenever the buffer
    is full, or when an event of a certain severity or greater is seen.
    flushLevelflushOnClose
        Initialize the handler with the buffer size, the level at which
        flushing should occur and an optional target.

        Note that without a target being set either here or via setTarget(),
        a MemoryHandler is no use to anyone!

        The ``flushOnClose`` argument is ``True`` for backward compatibility
        reasons - the old behaviour is that when the handler is closed, the
        buffer is flushed, even if the flush level hasn't been exceeded nor the
        capacity exceeded. To prevent this, set ``flushOnClose`` to ``False``.
        
        Check for buffer full or a record at the flushLevel or higher.
        setTarget
        Set the target handler for this handler.
        
        For a MemoryHandler, flushing means just sending the buffered
        records to the target, if there is one. Override if you want
        different behaviour.

        The record buffer is also cleared by this operation.
        
        Flush, if appropriately configured, set the target to None and lose the
        buffer.
        QueueHandler
    This handler sends events to a queue. Typically, it would be used together
    with a multiprocessing Queue to centralise logging to file in one process
    (in a multi-process application), so as to avoid file write contention
    between processes.

    This code is new in Python 3.2, but this class can be copy pasted into
    user code for use with earlier Python versions.
    
        Initialise an instance, using the passed queue.
        enqueue
        Enqueue a record.

        The base implementation uses put_nowait. You may want to override
        this method if you want to use blocking, timeouts or custom queue
        implementations.
        prepare
        Prepares a record for queuing. The object returned by this method is
        enqueued.

        The base implementation formats the record to merge the message
        and arguments, and removes unpickleable items from the record
        in-place.

        You might want to override this method if you want to convert
        the record to a dict or JSON string, or send a modified copy
        of the record while leaving the original intact.
        
        Emit a record.

        Writes the LogRecord to the queue, preparing it for pickling first.
        QueueListener
    This class implements an internal threaded listener which watches for
    LogRecords being added to a queue, removes them and passes them to a
    list of handlers for processing.
    respect_handler_level
        Initialise an instance with the specified queue and
        handlers.
        dequeue
        Dequeue a record and return it, optionally blocking.

        The base implementation uses get. You may want to override this method
        if you want to use timeouts or work with custom queue implementations.
        
        Start the listener.

        This starts up a background thread to monitor the queue for
        LogRecords to process.
        Thread_monitor
        Prepare a record for handling.

        This method just returns the passed-in record. You may want to
        override this method if you need to do any custom marshalling or
        manipulation of the record before passing it to the handlers.
        
        Handle a record.

        This just loops through the handlers offering them the record
        to handle.
        
        Monitor the queue for records, and ask the handler
        to deal with them.

        This method runs on a separate, internal thread.
        The thread will terminate if it sees a sentinel object in the queue.
        has_task_doneenqueue_sentinel
        This is used to enqueue the sentinel record.

        The base implementation uses put_nowait. You may want to override this
        method if you want to use timeouts or work with custom queue
        implementations.
        
        Stop the listener.

        This asks the thread to terminate, and then waits for it to do so.
        Note that if you don't call this before your application exits, there
        may be some records still left on the queue, which won't be processed.

'b'
    Base class for handlers that rotate log files at a certain point.
    Not meant to be instantiated directly.  Instead, use RotatingFileHandler
    or TimedRotatingFileHandler.
    'u'
    Base class for handlers that rotate log files at a certain point.
    Not meant to be instantiated directly.  Instead, use RotatingFileHandler
    or TimedRotatingFileHandler.

        Use the specified filename for streamed logging
        'u'
        Use the specified filename for streamed logging
        'b'
        Emit a record.

        Output the record to the file, catering for rollover as described
        in doRollover().
        'u'
        Emit a record.

        Output the record to the file, catering for rollover as described
        in doRollover().
        'b'
        Modify the filename of a log file when rotating.

        This is provided so that a custom filename can be provided.

        The default implementation calls the 'namer' attribute of the
        handler, if it's callable, passing the default name to
        it. If the attribute isn't callable (the default is None), the name
        is returned unchanged.

        :param default_name: The default name for the log file.
        'u'
        Modify the filename of a log file when rotating.

        This is provided so that a custom filename can be provided.

        The default implementation calls the 'namer' attribute of the
        handler, if it's callable, passing the default name to

        is returned unchanged.

        :param default_name: The default name for the log file.
        'b'
        When rotating, rotate the current log.

        The default implementation calls the 'rotator' attribute of the
        handler, if it's callable, passing the source and dest arguments to
        it. If the attribute isn't callable (the default is None), the source
        is simply renamed to the destination.

        :param source: The source filename. This is normally the base
                       filename, e.g. 'test.log'
        :param dest:   The destination filename. This is normally
                       what the source is rotated to, e.g. 'test.log.1'.
        'u'
        When rotating, rotate the current log.

        'b'
    Handler for logging to a set of files, which switches from one file
    to the next when the current file reaches a certain size.
    'u'
    Handler for logging to a set of files, which switches from one file
    to the next when the current file reaches a certain size.
    'b'
        Open the specified file and use it as the stream for logging.

        By default, the file grows indefinitely. You can specify particular
        values of maxBytes and backupCount to allow the file to rollover at
        a predetermined size.

        Rollover occurs whenever the current log file is nearly maxBytes in
        length. If backupCount is >= 1, the system will successively create
        new files with the same pathname as the base file, but with extensions
        ".1", ".2" etc. appended to it. For example, with a backupCount of 5
        and a base file name of "app.log", you would get "app.log",
        "app.log.1", "app.log.2", ... through to "app.log.5". The file being
        written to is always "app.log" - when it gets filled up, it is closed
        and renamed to "app.log.1", and if files "app.log.1", "app.log.2" etc.
        exist, then they are renamed to "app.log.2", "app.log.3" etc.
        respectively.

        If maxBytes is zero, rollover never occurs.
        'u'
        Open the specified file and use it as the stream for logging.

        start of the interval, not the current time.  If there is a backup count,
        then we have to get a list of matching filenames, sort them and remove
        the one with the oldest suffix.

        'b'
    A handler for logging to a file, which watches the file
    to see if it has changed while in use. This can happen because of
    usage of programs such as newsyslog and logrotate which perform
    log file rotation. This handler, intended for use under Unix,
    watches the file to see if it has changed since the last emit.
    (A file has changed if its device or inode have changed.)
    If it has changed, the old file stream is closed, and the file
    opened to get a new stream.

    This handler is not appropriate for use under Windows, because
    under Windows open files cannot be moved or renamed - logging
    opens the files with exclusive locks - and so there is no need
    for such a handler. Furthermore, ST_INO is not supported under
    Windows; stat always returns zero for this value.

    This handler is based on a suggestion and patch by Chad J.
    Schroeder.

    'b'
        Reopen log file if needed.

        Checks if the underlying file has changed, and if it
        has, close the old stream and reopen the file to get the
        current stream.

        'b'
    A handler class which writes logging records, in pickle format, to
    a streaming socket. The socket is kept open across logging calls.
    If the peer resets it, an attempt is made to reconnect on the next call.
    The pickle which is sent is that of the LogRecord's attribute dictionary
    (__dict__), so that the receiver does not need to have the logging module
    installed in order to process the logging event.

    To unpickle the record at the receiving end into a LogRecord, use the
    makeLogRecord function.

    'b'
        Initializes the handler with a specific host address and port.

        When the attribute *closeOnError* is set to True - if a socket error
        occurs, the socket is silently closed and then reopened on the next
        logging call.
        'u'
        Initializes the handler with a specific host address and port.
